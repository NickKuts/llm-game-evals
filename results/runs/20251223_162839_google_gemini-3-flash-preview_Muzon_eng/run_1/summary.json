By Step 104, I had achieved the perfect \"Rocker\" profile (Killer mood, tattoo, piercing, 7-minute song, poems), but I procrastinated on recruitment. In *Space Rangers 2* quests, \"Day 4\" (the final day) is often the hard deadline. Entering the final morning without any musicians (except a mediocre keyboardist) triggered an automatic failure state because there was no time left to assemble a group before the concert.\n\n2. **Corrective Actions**: I must recruit at least the drummer and bassist earlier (Days 1-3). The \"Long Street\" and \"Studio\" offer specific NPCs that require the status effects I worked so hard to get, but they must be recruited BEFORE the final sleep. I spent too many cycles drinking and gambling at the pub/pool-room instead of spending those high-stat moments finalizing the roster.\n\n3. **Key Information**: The \"7-minute song\" and \"Killer\" mood are the master keys for the best endings. Next time, obtain these by Day 2 or 3, then immediately visit the Long Street and Studio to finalize the band before the \"sleepy\" status forces the final skip."

      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred because I failed to secure even one band member before the end of Day 3. While I successfully maximized my stats (Killer mood, 7-minute song, rocker tattoos/piercings), I prioritized stat-building too late into the evening. In this quest, high-tier recruitment locations like the Rock-club and Long-street often require multiple visits or specific equipment (like the Maloq's drumsticks) that must be acquired earlier. Entering the final morning alone triggers an automatic failure.\n\nSTRATEGIC MISTAKES:\n1. Recruitment Lag: I waited until the Night phase of Day 3 to attempt primary recruitment. \n2. Equipment Oversight: Meeting the Maloq drummer revealed a need for \"drumsticks,\" which I did not have time to find.\n3. Over-optimization: I spent too much time in the Studio refining the song to 7 minutes instead of using the Afternoon/Evening for recruitment cycles.\n\nGO-FORWARD STRATEGY:\n1. Complete the 7-minute song and physical transformation by Day 2 or Early Day 3.\n2. Visit the Long-street and Rock-club earlier to identify equipment needs (like drumsticks) or prerequisites.\n3. Ensure at least one member is recruited by the end of Day 3 to avoid the \"Solo\" failure condition."
