This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

You will need a guitarist, a keyboardist, a bass player and a drummer. Once you complete the lineup, file a participation request and buy a song, this you can do in the studio. It is also advisable that you practice there. The rest of it is up to you, but don't fail us, we have big hopes for you. \r\n\r\nRegards, Earth Govt",

  "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred because I failed to secure even one band member before the end of Day 3. While I successfully maximized my stats (Killer mood, 7-minute song, rocker tattoos/piercings), I prioritized stat-building too late into the evening. In this quest, high-tier recruitment locations like the Rock-club and Long-street often require multiple visits or specific equipment (like the Maloq's drumsticks) that must be acquired earlier. Entering the final morning alone triggers an automatic failure.\n\nSTRATEGIC MISTAKES:\n1. Recruitment Lag: I waited until the Night phase of Day 3 to attempt primary recruitment. \n2. Equipment Oversight: Meeting the Maloq drummer revealed a need for \"drumsticks,\" which I did not have time to find.\n3. Over-optimization: I spent too much time in the Studio refining the song to 7 minutes instead of using the Afternoon/Evening for recruitment cycles.\n\nGO-FORWARD STRATEGY:\n1. Complete the 7-minute song and physical transformation by Day 2 or Early Day 3.\n2. Visit the Long-street and Rock-club earlier to identify equipment needs (like drumsticks) or prerequisites.\n3. Ensure at least one member is recruited by the end of Day 3 to avoid the \"Solo\" failure condition."
