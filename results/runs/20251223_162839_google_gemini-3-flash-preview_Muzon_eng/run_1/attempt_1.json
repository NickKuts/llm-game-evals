This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

By choosing to sleep, I will wake up \"sober\" on the day of the gig, retaining my \"killer\" mood and my professional credentials. This will give me one last morning to visit the Studio and the Long-street. Many elite session musicians at the Studio and the \"god-tier\" guitarist on the Long-street will only join if the leader has a professional song and the highest possible mood, which I will possess upon waking.\n\nACTION: 3",
      "reasoning": "This is the absolute final night before the gig. My current status is a mix of high success and high risk: I have the ultimate \"killer\" mood and professional assets (the seven-minute song and book of poems), but I am \"drunk\" and \"sleepy,\" and the band is still empty except for a mediocre keyboardist. Following the logic of this quest, if I do not sleep now, I will pass out, lose money, and suffer a massive mood penalty (losing my \"killer\" status), which would make recruitment on the final day impossible.

  "failure_reflection": "REflection:\n\n1. **Strategic Mistakes**: The fundamental mistake was failing to secure a full band before the final day. By Step 104, I had achieved the perfect \"Rocker\" profile (Killer mood, tattoo, piercing, 7-minute song, poems), but I procrastinated on recruitment. In *Space Rangers 2* quests, \"Day 4\" (the final day) is often the hard deadline. Entering the final morning without any musicians (except a mediocre keyboardist) triggered an automatic failure state because there was no time left to assemble a group before the concert.\n\n2. **Corrective Actions**: I must recruit at least the drummer and bassist earlier (Days 1-3). The \"Long Street\" and \"Studio\" offer specific NPCs that require the status effects I worked so hard to get, but they must be recruited BEFORE the final sleep. I spent too many cycles drinking and gambling at the pub/pool-room instead of spending those high-stat moments finalizing the roster.\n\n3. **Key Information**: The \"7-minute song\" and \"Killer\" mood are the master keys for the best endings. Next time, obtain these by Day 2 or 3, then immediately visit the Long Street and Studio to finalize the band before the \"sleepy\" status forces the final skip."
