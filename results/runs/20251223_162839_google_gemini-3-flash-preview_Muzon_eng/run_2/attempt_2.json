This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

When you see the \"Disk C: format complete 50%\" in the dialogue window, then quickly transfer all of the information to the right, and continue formatting the left side of the disk.

I currently have a keyboardist and a drummer, both \"good,\" meaning I am missing only two members: a guitarist and a bassist. In my previous attempts and interactions, I learned that elite musicians have high standards regarding my mood and reputation. Right now, my \"mood is not the best\" and I am \"sober.\" While there is a risk he might reject me (similar to the bassist in the pub), I have 2 days left and 255 rockarollars. Attempting to recruit him now is the most logical path because if he accepts, I secure an elite member. If he rejects me, I still have time to go to the pub, improve my mood/sobriety, and try again or find a less demanding guitarist. Filling the guitarist slot is a top priority to avoid the \"incomplete band\" failure of the first attempt.",

  "failure_reflection": "STRATEGIC REFLECTION:\n\n1. **Logical Mistakes:** I spent too much time in the Pool Room gambling for money I didn't need. Money (155 rockarollars) is useless without a full band. The critical mistake was over-pursuing the \"Drunk Peleng\" clue at the expense of time. By the time I tried to use the laptop for emergency recruitment, I was \"very sleepy!!!\" and passed out mid-action. I also ignored the \"reading\" clue; I should have visited the Laptop's Library earlier in the mission to understand how to win the pool game efficiently or unlock a specific musician.\n\n2. **Course Correction:** Prioritize the band lineup over reputation/stats by mid-day of Day 2. Do not wait until the final night to find the last two members. Use the Laptop Library immediately on Day 1 to gather all intelligence. \n\n3. **Key Discoveries:**\n   - Entering the \"very sleepy!!!\" state is a hard cutoff; your next action (besides sleeping) will likely cause a knockout.\n   - Being \"a bit drunk\" allows you to win at pool, but it blocks elite recruitment (like the Bassist in the pub).\n   - \"Killer mood\" and rock gear (Tattoo/Piercing) are essential, but must be obtained earlier to save night-time for recruitment."
