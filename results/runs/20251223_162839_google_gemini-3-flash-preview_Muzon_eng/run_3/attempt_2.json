This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

  "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred because I chose to sleep when there was still 1 day remaining, causing time to advance to the day of the concert without a full band. In this quest, \"1 day left\" means the final full day of preparation, and \"0 days left\" is the concert day. By sleeping, I jumped directly to the end of the quest timeline.\n\nStrategically, I should have realized that the final recruitment (Drummer and Guitarist) and the all-important Studio phase (Songwriting and Rehearsing) must be completed *before* the final sleep. My mistake was being overly cautious about the \"sleepy\" status; the game allows several actions while sleepy before forcing a collapse.\n\nFor the next attempt:\n1. Complete the roster (recruit all 4 members) *before* the final day.\n2. Use the \"1 day left\" period to perform all Studio actions: Write/Buy a song and Rehearse at least twice.\n3. Only sleep when the roster is full and the song is rehearsed.\n4. Optimal Path: Day 2 (Quest items) -> Night 2 (Keyboardist/Pool) -> Day 1 (Guitarist/Drummer/Studio) -> Final sleep."
