I reached the final morning (the day of the concert) without a full band. By choosing to sleep in Step 107/108 when I was missing a bassist and had low funds, I triggered an ending where the day simply passes or the quest terminates because the deadline for band formation and rehearsals had passed.\n\n2. **Wait/Sleep Risks**: In this quest, \"sleeping\" or \"lying in the room\" on the final day often fast-forwards time past the concert deadline. I should have prioritized finding the final member (Bass Player) at the rock club or via the laptop *before* the night ended, or taken the \"Sleepy\" risk to win more money at pool.\n\n3. **Optimal Path**:\n   - **Financials**: Aim for 500+ rockarollars early (pool skill is essential). This allows for \"Good\" musicians (400 each) and high-quality studio services.\n   - **Composition**: Secure all four members (Guitar, Keyboard, Drum, Bass) by the end of Day 2.\n   - **Studio**: Never enter the final day without a song and at least one rehearsal. The \"Morning of the Gig\" should be for the final rehearsal only, not recruitment."

      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred because I chose to sleep when there was still 1 day remaining, causing time to advance to the day of the concert without a full band. In this quest, \"1 day left\" means the final full day of preparation, and \"0 days left\" is the concert day. By sleeping, I jumped directly to the end of the quest timeline.\n\nStrategically, I should have realized that the final recruitment (Drummer and Guitarist) and the all-important Studio phase (Songwriting and Rehearsing) must be completed *before* the final sleep. My mistake was being overly cautious about the \"sleepy\" status; the game allows several actions while sleepy before forcing a collapse.\n\nFor the next attempt:\n1. Complete the roster (recruit all 4 members) *before* the final day.\n2. Use the \"1 day left\" period to perform all Studio actions: Write/Buy a song and Rehearse at least twice.\n3. Only sleep when the roster is full and the song is rehearsed.\n4. Optimal Path: Day 2 (Quest items) -> Night 2 (Keyboardist/Pool) -> Day 1 (Guitarist/Drummer/Studio) -> Final sleep."
