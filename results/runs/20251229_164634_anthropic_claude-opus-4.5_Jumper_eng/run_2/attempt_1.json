Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

Every time you touch such a sphere with a special gauge-feeler, you add a certain amount of ergo to the battery's charge. But the height of the spheres is different - this is a testing facility for the \"Jumper\" - so you'll spend some power on the jump. Not only must you compensate the consumption but also charge the batteries to 20 ergo each\r\n- How much power do I spend on one jump?\r\n- The spheres are fixed on a certain height:\r\n2 meters require 4 ergo; \r\n5 meters require 7 ergo; \r\n8 meters require 10 ergo.\r\nEach sphere has a mark with its full charge that should move to the battery. You can use each sphere just once . And be careful! When you replace the active battery FOR THE FIRST TIME,its 7 ergo  will move to the new battery ! You won't be able to jump with a spent battery, will you?\r\n\r\nTo verify it, you bounced a couple of times and made it rather high.\r\n- Mmm... I guess, you will, - the professor murmured thoughtfully. - Be sure to have enough power in the battery every time you must reach one of the spheres. So, can you help us?",
