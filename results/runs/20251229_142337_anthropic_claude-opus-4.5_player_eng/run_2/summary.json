Box 5 is in ALL four 2x2 squares AND one vertical line (2-5-8), so when it turned black, the adversary could still choose from 5 different patterns. 3. **Wrong second box choice**: After box 5 was black, checking box 1 was suboptimal. Box 1 only rules out ONE square (1-2-4-5). The adversary simply avoided that pattern. ## What to do differently: The key insight: I need TWO boxes that together can distinguish ALL squares from ALL vertical lines, even with adversarial first-move setup. **Better strategy**: Start with a corner like box 1 or 7. This limits which patterns the adversary can choose. Then pick a second box that definitively separates remaining possibilities. **Critical constraint**: Box 9 is broken, so vertical line 3-6-9 and squares containing 9 must be considered carefully. ## Important Info: - Grid is..."

At Step 7, I analyzed box 4 as my best option but then wrote \"ACTION: 3\" instead of \"ACTION: 4\". This was a critical execution error.\n\n2. **Incomplete strategic analysis before starting.** The puzzle is adversarial (pattern chosen AFTER first pick to maximize difficulty) and box 9 is broken. I needed a guaranteed 2-box strategy that works regardless of adversary response.\n\n**What to do differently:**\n\n1. **Be extremely careful that ACTION matches my analysis.** Double-check the number before submitting.\n\n2. **Find guaranteed winning strategy first:** Need a first box choice where BOTH possible colors lead to a distinguishing second box. Key insight: box 5 appears in ALL squares but only line {2,5,8}. Starting with box 5 might be optimal.\n\n3. **Systematically analyze:** After first box result, identify which patterns remain, then find a second box that separates ALL remaining lines from ALL remaining squares.\n\n**Key Information:**\n- 2x2 squares: {1,2,4,5}, {2,3,5,6}, {4,5,7,8}, {5,6,8,9}\n- Vertical lines: {1,4,7}, {2,5,8}, {3,6,9}\n- Box 9 is broken (can't test)\n- Adversarial setup"
