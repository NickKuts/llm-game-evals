The Pelengs rigged the tuner so the pattern is set AFTER you pick the first box, choosing \"the most inconvenient manner\" - meaning the adversary picks whichever pattern makes your choice useless. **The Real Puzzle:** This is a game theory problem, not just logic. I need to find TWO boxes that can distinguish between ALL possible 2x2 squares and ALL possible vertical lines, even when an adversary chooses the pattern after my first pick. **My Error:** I chose box 5, then box 7. Box 7 is black in only ONE square pattern (4,5,7,8). The adversary simply chose that pattern, making both my boxes black and giving no distinguishing information. **Correct Strategy:** I need boxes where: - For ANY square pattern, at least one check gives different result than ALL line patterns - Box 9 is unavailable The vertical lines are: {1,4,7}, {2,5,8}, {3,6,9} The 2x2 squares use different distributions. **Next Time:** Choose boxes that create a \"forcing\" situation - where no matter what the adversary picks, the two results together uniquely identify square vs. line. Likely need to check boxes like 2 and 4, or similar..."
