This wasted my only distinguishing check.\n\n**The Puzzle Logic:**\n- Box 9 is broken (can't check it)\n- The Peleng tuner is adversarial - it sets the pattern AFTER my first choice to be maximally inconvenient\n- I need to find 2 boxes that can distinguish a 2x2 square from a vertical line of 3, regardless of how the adversary arranges the pattern\n\n**Correct Strategy:**\nAfter checking box 5 (which is in ALL squares but only the middle vertical line):\n- If box 5 is BLACK: Check box 4 or box 6\n  - Box 4/6 BLACK \u2192 definitely a SQUARE (these aren't in vertical line {2,5,8})\n  - Box 4/6 WHITE \u2192 definitely a LINE (vertical line {2,5,8})\n\n**What I Should Have Done:**\nIn Step 7, I should have entered \"4\" or \"6\" instead of \"5\". My reasoning was correct but I input the wrong number.\n\n**Next Time:**\n1. Double-check the ACTION number matches my reasoning\n2. First check: Box 5\n3. Second check: Box 4 or Box 6 (NOT box 5 again!)"

The adversarial Peleng tuner sets the pattern AFTER my first choice to make things maximally difficult. By choosing box 5, I allowed the adversary to make it black (putting it in multiple possible patterns), then choose box 4 which they made white - leaving me unable to distinguish between the vertical line {2,5,8} and squares {2,3,5,6} or {5,6,8,9}.\n\n**What I Should Do Differently:**\nThe correct first move must be a box that forces a distinguishable situation regardless of adversary response. I need to find two boxes where:\n- No matter what the adversary sets after my first pick\n- My second pick definitively separates SQUARE from LINE\n\n**Key Information:**\n- Box 9 is BROKEN (cannot check it)\n- Adversary sets pattern AFTER first box choice\n- Patterns: 2x2 squares OR vertical 3-line\n- Possible squares: {1,2,4,5}, {2,3,5,6}, {4,5,7,8}, {5,6,8,9}\n- Possible lines: {1,4,7}, {2,5,8}, {3,6,9}\n\n**Next Attempt:**\nTry starting with a CORNER box (1, 3, or 7 - not 9 which is broken). This may create better forced separation since corners appear in fewer patterns."
