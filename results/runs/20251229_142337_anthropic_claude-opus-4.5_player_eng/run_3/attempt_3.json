Well, this technology outmoded three hundred years ago, but it is still used on some backward planets... \r\n\r\nThe thing is that they accidentally broke the DND-player kept in the Museum of Faeyan Technology on Bonnasis in the Procyon system. And nobody on the whole planet knows how to repair it. So all the Faeyan planets are drafting rangers from the backward planets hoping to find at least one expert among them who will solve the problem. There aren't many chances though but what else can they do? All told, if you are ready to go to Bonnasis in 35 days and fix the player, we'll pay you 65535 cr. Is it a deal?",

And it works very well despite its old age! Unfortunately, some strange  failure  happened to it not long ago (I suspect that one of those disgusting tourists tried to play a pirate disk on our DND-player, which caused all the trouble!), and now it chews 95% of all the played disks. It has already chewed 18 disks!!! As long as DND-disks are expensive rarities themselves these days, we ought to take measures and have the player fixed.

In the first of them the black boxes are organised in a square 2*2 boxes in size, and in the second one they form a vertical line of three boxes . The problem is in defining the overtone type.(that is, find out if it's a square or a line because their exact order is not important at all). The tuner lets one find out the colour of any two boxes. The manual says that it's quite enough for the experts to define the overtone type, but it doesn't give even a hint to how one can do it. If you know the overtone type, all you need to do is just to push the other button, and the further tuning will be done automatically. Unfortunately, if one chooses the wrong overtone type, the further tuning can destroy the player completely. Taking into consideration the unicity of this particular DND-player, we don't let anybody do the further tuning if there is just a small possibility of damaging it.",
