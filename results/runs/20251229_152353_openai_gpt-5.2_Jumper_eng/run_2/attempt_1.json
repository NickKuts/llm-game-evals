If I have 13 left, I can't do the jump and would have to switch to battery #2. Being on an even platform works better for potential long jumps, so landing there is safer. I'll choose Yellow-4 for 8 ergo instead.**Maximizing efficiency in battery use**\n\nI have 12 in the active battery, which isn\u2019t enough for a 15 ergo jump. I can swap at platform 4 if necessary, so that's reassuring. While Yellow-2 costs me 10 ergo for 8m and allows for a swap, I think Yellow-4 is the better choice since it\u2019s both even and relatively low cost. This way, I can focus on energy efficiency and maintain flexibility. I\u2019ll keep battery #1 active for now, and swap if I need to make a longer jump later."

Managing energy for the remaining Blue and Green is important, and the teleport can be used in Blue/Green. With active battery2 at 19 and spare battery1 at 5, there might be an accelerator on the first platform. Since battery1 is low, landing on an even platform could help with a battery swap. Platform 2 or 4 will provide more flexibility for future jumps.**Evaluating jump options**\n\nI\u2019m considering options where I can go from Violet-3 to either Blue-2 or Blue-4, both costing 7 ergo for a 5-meter jump. Blue-3, which is odd, costs only 4 ergo but doesn\u2019t have a swap device. I could land there with 15 ergo left, yet it might be better to aim for an even platform like blue-2 or blue-4 for a replacement device and possible teleportation. Since teleportation can only be used once, I should save it for later if needed. I'm unsure which is better for distance, but blue-2 might be closer to the green row.**Choosing the safest jump**\n\nFrom Violet-3, the easiest jump is to Blue-3, which is only 2 meters and costs 4 ergo, but it could be a trap since it's odd. Although we might need a battery swap later, we can move to either blue-2 or blue-4 after that. Conserving ergo is key, so blue-3 seems the safest choice right now. Even with 15 ergo left, I might need to reach an even platform for a swap later. However, large distances could be a problem. There might be an accelerator on the first platform, but it's not one of the current options.**Assessing jump strategies**\n\nIf the accelerator on the first platform of the blue row could send me to the first platform of the next sector for just 1 ergo, that would be great, but I can\u2019t currently reach blue-1 since it's not an option. The accelerator might be located elsewhere. Landing on blue-2 is beneficial because it's even; I could swap to battery1 with 5 ergo left for smaller jumps, like 2m or 4m. Using battery1 for smaller jumps would help save battery2 for potential long jumps. Additionally, blue-2 is closer to the center than blue-4, making it a more strategic choice.**Deciding on the optimal jump**\n\nLanding on a middle platform will give me more jump options, and I think I'll choose blue-2. It costs 7 ergo, which leaves me with 12 in battery2. On blue-2, I can swap to battery1 with 5 ergo for some small hops or potentially use the teleport if needed. Blue-3 might cost less (4 ergo), but overall, going directly to blue-2 is better. I\u2019ll compute the distance now: jumping from Violet-3 to blue-2 is 5m and costs 7.

The direct jump to Green-2 consumes a lot of energy, leaving battery2 low, which isn't ideal. So, I\u2019m leaning towards choosing Green-1 instead. Also, I need to consider moving to Blue-1 first to look for an accelerator, although the costs of energy usage need to be managed. Blue-1 might have the accelerator I'm considering.**Exploring accelerator options**\n\nI\u2019m considering an accelerator that could take me to the first platform of the next sector, Green-1, for just 1 ergo. If we want to optimize, I should check Blue-1, since an accelerator could be there\u2014maybe even on other rows like Yellow-1 or Red-1. However, traveling to Blue-1 from Blue-2 costs 5 ergo, which makes the total cost to reach Green-1 actually higher unless the accelerator offers a shortcut beyond Green. I need to think this through!**Evaluating sector transitions and battery swaps**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how the accelerator might transfer me to the first platform of the next sector for just 1 ergo. I\u2019m considering that \"next sector\" could mean transitioning from Blue to Green, and then to a final point. If there's an accelerator on Green-1, could it send me directly to the final platform? It\u2019s a possibility, but I won\u2019t know unless I explore, which costs energy. Therefore, the best option seems to be checking Green-1 and maybe swapping batteries at Blue-2 now.**Deciding on battery usage**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that if I don\u2019t swap batteries at Green-1, I\u2019ll have 0 active with battery1, and that\u2019s not good. So, it seems like that's not a viable option. I think I need to prioritize keeping my teleport option open instead.

I need to reach the final point, presumably accessible from the Green row, and jumping to Green-2 seems necessary.

There are three platforms in the green row, and I\u2019m currently at the first one.

However, if it turns out to be 8m, I'd need 10 ergo, which would mean teleporting back and restarting. If I teleport now, I could recharge both batteries, but then I'd have to navigate again. Still, it's wise to consider teleporting if I risk getting stuck. I've got 7 ergo left, plus a spare 5 that I can only access after jumping to Green-2.

I think I should categorize my actions accordingly. I need to ensure my reasoning is thorough and follows the required format with proper analysis.

Even if I decline, the mission might still end with a payout. However, the bonus of 1000 credits is tempting, and the puzzle seems deterministic. So, if I'm careful, I might as well accept it!"

Each sphere charges the batteries, and I need to charge both to 20. Currently, battery one is at 4, and battery two is at 0, so I need to add a total of 36 ergo. I should remember that replacing the first battery gives a transfer of 7 ergo to the new active battery. I need to strategize which spheres to use.**Maximizing ergo gain**\n\nI need to consider how much ergo each sphere adds to the battery's charge versus the cost of jumping. Every jump uses ergo, and I need to ensure I have enough to reach the next spheres. For instance, jumping to a sphere at 2m costs 4 ergo, leaving me at zero, but then I gain 8 ergo from the sphere, resulting in a net increase of 4. I should prioritize using spheres with larger charges first to avoid getting stuck at zero. It's all about maximizing my gains while making sure I can keep jumping!**Strategizing battery swaps and jumps**\n\nOnce I touch a sphere, my battery charges, which is great! For example, using sphere one at 2m height gives me a net gain of 4 ergo after the jump, bringing my battery up to 8. It's definitely better than sphere two, which only gives a net gain of 2. \n\nI need to plan for battery swapping since I currently have none in reserve. Swapping the active battery gives a bonus of 7 ergo, allowing me to use battery two even from zero. I think timing my first swap early is wise to maximize that benefit!**Planning the battery swap strategy**\n\nI need to think about when to swap to battery two. If it already has some charge when I swap, I might waste potential because it has a cap of 20. It's better to swap when battery two has zero charge to maximize the benefit. \n\nI'll focus on charging battery one first and plan to swap to battery two later, so I can gain the 7 ergo boost. I\u2019m wondering if that 7 is truly a bonus or just a transfer from the system. Either way, it seems advantageous! But will it reduce the active battery\u2019s charge?**Understanding battery transfer mechanics**\n\nIt looks like the \"7 ergo\" mentioned refers to the replacement device, which adds this amount to the new battery when I swap it for the first time. This likely means that I don\u2019t need to factor that 7 into the 36 ergo I need to gather, because it'll be a bonus to the newly activated battery.\n\nSo, to reach a total of 40 from my current 4, I effectively need to add only 29 through spheres.

It's also likely possible to replace a battery without power!**Deciding on sphere usage**\n\nI think using sphere3 is the best action because I can afford the 5m jump costing 7 ergo, leaving me with 1 ergo and a total of 12 after gaining +11. That gives a net gain of +4. Sphere2 has a lower cost of 4 but only gives a +2 net gain. Sphere3 requires at least 7 ergo to work, so it's best to use it now. It seems I should also ensure that the active battery has at least 7 ergo before making any transfers to avoid losing the ability.**Planning battery and sphere strategy**\n\nI have 8 ergo, which is fine, but using sphere3 will increase battery1 to 12, keeping it above 7. My strategy is to maximize the value of spheres and get both batteries to 20 each. It seems wise to scout the second platform for more spheres, potentially with higher yields. I'll definitely prioritize using sphere3 first for its high yield\u2014after that, battery1 will be at 12, and I\u2019ll need 28 more to proceed.

This way, we can use spheres to charge battery2 up to 20 while battery1 has some leftover. The best approach might be using sphere3 first to get to 12, then swapping to battery2, which will leave battery1 at 5. If I can use sphere2, it will recharge battery2 by 6 at a cost of 4. However, sphere2 is only available on platform1, so I need to think about possible larger spheres on platform2 too.**Evaluating platform movement and sphere strategy**\n\nI think it could be better to move to platform2 now to investigate, especially since it seems we can cross the bridge without a power cost. There's some uncertainty about jumping to touch spheres while on the bridge, but I might be able to explore platform2 early to decide the best order for using spheres. However, I need to remember that I have sphere3 requiring 7 ergo. If I find an 8m sphere needing 10, I may need to charge up first.

I should probably wait until the old battery has at least 7 before swapping to maximize the gain.**Planning battery swaps and charges**\n\nBattery2 is currently at zero, which makes sense since I want to schedule the first swap when battery1 has at least 7 energy. I remember that swaps happen on the platform and don\u2019t require power. After the swap, battery2 will get the charge plus 7, while battery1 will drop by that amount.

Using sphere4 to gain 16 at an active level of 12 costs 10, bringing me to 18. However, using sphere5 could push it to 22, which risks wasting energy if there\u2019s a cap. It might be wise to swap to battery2 first and transfer 7 from battery1. Once battery2 has enough charge, I can use sphere5 later. But first, I might use sphere2 to boost battery2 to 9 before tackling the bigger spheres.**Preparing to charge battery2**\n\nStarting from 7 after using sphere2 gives me just 9, which isn't enough for an 8m sphere since I need at least 10. I\u2019m considering using sphere2 or sphere5 with battery1, but I might waste energy. Instead, it could be better to explore platform2 for additional spheres while making sure to keep battery1 filled. The plan is to get battery2 to 20, taking advantage of the swap to transfer 7. I think I\u2019ll use sphere4 to gain energy and then explore platform2 for suitable spheres to recharge battery2 effectively. Let's go with sphere4!"

It seems I can\u2019t jump with 0 ergo or a drained battery. I see that with 7 ergo, b2 can reach a 2m sphere but not the larger ones. My plan is to charge b1 to 20 using sphere2, but I realized transferring ergo later would lower b1's charge. Maybe I should swap earlier!**Planning battery transfer**\n\nI'm considering how the transfer works during the first swap. It seems b1 must have at least 7 ergo to make a swap happen. No swapping means I can't charge b2 effectively; i.e., b1 will drop by 7 and b2 will gain that. Since I need b1 to regain energy after the swap, it's crucial not to overfill it with high-value spheres before the swap. That way, I'm not wasting energy since it can't store beyond 20. After the swap, b1 will be at 11, so I can still add energy later!**Calculating sphere usage**\n\nUsing sphere5 on b1 right now seems like a waste. If I spend 10 ergo, b1 would go to 22, but it's capped at 20, so I\u2019d lose 2 ergo, which isn\u2019t good since I need total energy. It's better to consider using it on b2 later after the swap. However, b2 starts with only 7, which isn\u2019t enough for the 8m sphere I want to charge it with. I may need to collect more spheres on the second platform before making a final decision!**Planning platform movement**\n\nIt looks like moving between platforms doesn't cost any energy, which is good! I need to add a total of 22 energy via spheres. I've gained 35 from spheres 1, 3, and 4, but I've spent 21 on jumps, leaving me with a net gain of 14 from my starting 4 ergo, bringing me to 18. With sphere2 and sphere5 left, I realize I need at least two more spheres since I can only get 20 here. I should avoid making b1 hit exactly 20 before swapping!**Deciding on battery swap**\n\nIf I swap now, b1 will drop to 13, which is fine because I can later use sphere5 to recharge b1 and also boost b2. However, to charge b2 effectively, I\u2019ll need to consider its needs\u2014especially since it requires bigger spheres later on. After the swap, b1 will be at 11 and b2 at 7, and I can use sphere2 on b2 to get it to 9. It\u2019s crucial to start charging b2 now while b1 has enough charge. Therefore, I believe the best immediate action is to replace the battery to activate b2!"

Currently, I have an active battery at 12 and a spare at 11, needing to add 17 more to reach 40. The total now is 23, so I do need that 17! There are three spheres with different heights and charges available, and I must fill both batteries to 20 each. I need to be cautious about not exceeding that limit, as excess could be wasted.**Considering battery adjustments**\n\nSo, my active battery starts at 12. If I pay 10 to gain 15, I end up with a net gain of 5, bringing it to 17. The spare battery is at 11, so the total becomes 28. I still need 12 more overall! To get to 20 for both batteries, I need to increase one by 3 and the other by 9. I have spheres left to use, but I must remember the jump costs and that I can\u2019t jump with a spent battery. Each jump to a sphere uses some charge!**Understanding sphere usage**\n\nI realized that after using a sphere, my active battery actually becomes equal to the sphere's charge value instead of adding to it. In Step 22, my active battery dropped to 4 after using sphere1, which had a charge of 8. This means I spent 4 to jump and ended up with 8. Then, in Step 23, I used sphere3, which cost me 7 but increased my charge to 12. \n\nSo the net is charge gain minus cost! I could use a sphere here and after activating a replacement device, I\u2019ll have to account for my energy usage as I swap between batteries.**Planning sphere usage**\n\nI need to ensure I can always access the spheres, especially those that require specific costs. For the 8m spheres, my active needs a minimum of 10 ergo. So, I should plan on keeping it at 10 or more. If I use sphere1, that costs 10, leaving me with 17. If I swap to battery1, it starts at 11, which is sufficient. After using an 8m sphere, battery1 would change accordingly. My goal is to end both batteries at 20, so I need to evaluate minimal sphere usage to achieve that.**Formulating sphere usage strategy**\n\nI'm looking at a strategy to use high-value spheres effectively for charging both batteries. For the 8m spheres, I need at least 10 ergo in my active battery. If I use sphere1, that will leave me with enough charge for battery2, bringing it to 20. I\u2019ll aim to charge battery1 next. \n\nTo achieve my goal of having both batteries at 20, I'll evaluate my options with the remaining spheres, ensuring I use them efficiently and avoid wasting charge. I\u2019m excited to see if I can make this work!**Deciding battery strategy**\n\nI need to figure out which battery to use. My current plan is to swap to battery1 and use sphere1, but I wonder whether it\u2019s optimal. Using sphere1 with battery2 will raise it to 17. However, I need to be cautious about overcharging battery2 later. If I use sphere3 and then sphere5, I could balance things better.\n\nMeanwhile, considering the swapping and sphere usage, it seems like I could stick to using sphere1 right away and monitor the charge levels afterward. After all, using the highest-value sphere may be my best bet.**Choosing the best action**\n\nI see that both strategies involve at least one swap. Starting with battery2 active, if I use sphere1 on it, I\u2019ll have to swap to battery1 later and then back to battery2 at the end for topping off. That\u2019s two swaps in total.\n\nAlternatively, if I start by swapping to battery1, I\u2019d have to do four swaps in total, which is more complicated. So, I\u2019ll stick to keeping battery2 active and use sphere1 now. It seems wise to avoid overcharging battery2 since I can use sphere2 afterward to reach exactly 20."

If I use sphere3 now, I\u2019ll have some available charges on platforms and need a net gain of +9 to reach battery1\u2019s target. Currently, battery1 starts at 11. I can charge it while active, but I must calculate if it\u2019s possible to find a combination without exceeding 20. I should remember that the jump cost is deducted from the active battery before adding the sphere's charge.**Analyzing battery charge strategy**\n\nI\u2019m calculating how to increase battery1 from 11 to 20. The net gain is computed as gain minus cost. To get that +9 net increase, I see that sphere2 gives me +3, sphere3 also gives +3, platform1 sphere2 offers +2, and sphere5 provides +4. A combination like +3, +2, and +4 works. I must ensure enough charge before each jump. However, using sphere5 first seems beneficial, but I'll need to rethink the sequence to avoid consuming sphere3 too early.**Planning sphere usage**\n\nI\u2019ve figured out that the remaining spheres can give a total net increase of +9, which is perfect, so there's no need for sphere3. After using sphere3 on battery2, I can swap to battery1 at 11 and use the remaining spheres efficiently. I think moving to platform1 should be free! \n\nSo, my sequence will be: first, use sphere3 to bring battery2 to 20. Then, switch to battery1, use sphere2 from platform2 to reach 14, move to platform1, and then use sphere5 to get to 18, before finishing with sphere2 to hit 20.**Checking battery levels for jumps**\n\nI need to ensure that battery1 has enough charge before each jump. At 14, it can reach sphere5, costing 10, which leaves me with 18 afterward. Then I can reach sphere2 at a cost of 4 and end up at 20. Alternatively, if I use sphere2 now with battery2, I\u2019d get it to 20 without much cost. That way, I still have sphere3 available as an option, providing me with flexibility for future moves. Choosing sphere2 seems like the smarter choice!**Deciding on sphere use strategy**\n\nI find myself choosing option 2 over option 3. While using sphere2 may consume a valuable +7 charge, it could be more useful later for charging battery1. If battery1 needs to hit 20, saving sphere2 might be wise, since it helps a lot at a lower cost. \n\nHowever, if I go for sphere3 with battery2 first, that makes both batteries reach 20 exactly. It feels a bit riskier with battery1 at 11 since I\u2019d need to manage jumps precisely. I think prioritizing sphere3 now gives me greater flexibility for future moves!**Choosing the optimal sphere**\n\nAlright, if I choose sphere3, I decrease the required addition by 3 to 9 for battery1. To reach the full goal of both batteries being at 20, charging battery2 with sphere3 will get it to full at 20, while battery1 starts at 11. I'm evaluating whether to use sphere3 or sphere2; while both provide +3, sphere2 offers flexibility with lower costs, especially for battery1.\n\nI think it\u2019s best to use sphere3 now to keep sphere2 available for fine-tuning later. I'll make sure that after the jump with sphere3, battery2 will remain at 20. Action 3 it is!"

If I use sphere5 with battery1 at 11, I\u2019ll gain a result capped at 15.**Planning net gains for battery management**\n\nIt looks like my net gain is +4, but it might be better to use both 2m spheres for net gains of +2 and +3, totaling the needed +9.
