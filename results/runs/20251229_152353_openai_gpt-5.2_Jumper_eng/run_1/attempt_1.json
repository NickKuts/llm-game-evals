Starting on platform 4 might put me at the edge of the row, which could be tricky.

Since distances between platforms vary from 2-10 meters, starting centrally could offer shorter jumps and more options. Yellow-2 seems like a good choice, even if it costs 10 and leaves my energy at 10. However, I also have to manage battery levels; if I jump to Yellow-2, I can't afford a more expensive jump afterward. Yellow-3 leaves me with more energy and lets me swap, which might give me the flexibility I need for bigger jumps later.**Planning battery management**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the swapping strategy and battery usage. It's good that I can swap back later on even platforms, which allows me to use my spare for a bigger jump.

Starting with a jump to Yellow-2 costs 10, which leaves me with some energy, but I need to strategize after that.**Deciding on the best platform**\n\nSince technicians suggest that 40 is enough, starting with a jump costing 10 seems reasonable. Now, I need to consider if Yellow-2 at 8m is the same as Yellow-1. I think aligning my starting point with the middle of the row makes Yellow-2 a better choice since it's more central. So, I\u2019ll definitely go with Yellow-2. I should also keep in mind the costs and devices involved to ensure my choice is thorough and well-reasoned!"

I have options like moving to Yellow-1 or Yellow-3, or further to Red-2, Red-4, or Red-3. My goal is to conserve energy and position for future jumps to Violet. Battery swapping is a possibility, and I\u2019m considering keeping the current 10 active for later. However, having 20 active for upcoming jumps would be beneficial. It's essential to weigh these decisions carefully!**Considering battery management**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that charging can add 12 ergo, but I probably can\u2019t exceed a capacity of 20. When reaching the Violet charger, it\u2019s likely best if my active battery isn\u2019t full; arriving with a lower charge could let me gain more from charging. Ideally, I\u2019d want to arrive with 8 or less to maximize the 12 added. Another strategy could be to keep the active battery low for more top-up and have a full spare for emergencies. It looks like my next move should be to Red-3, since it has the lowest energy cost.**Evaluating jump options**\n\nI'm considering that moving from Red-3 might allow for shorter jumps later. Also, swapping can only happen on even platforms. If I go to Red-3, the next row will be Violet. However, if I need to swap, I'll have to pay extra to go back to Red-2 or Red-4. Red-2 is even but comes with a high cost. Going to Red-3 now will reduce my active battery to 6, which could limit my next jump to Violet if it requires 10-15 ergo. I need to ensure I have enough in my active battery or land on an even platform for easier swaps!**Considering battery swap strategy**\n\nIt's safer to go to Red-2 or Red-4 despite the higher cost of 8, as this ensures I can swap devices. I could also move to Yellow-3, but that won't allow for a swap, which isn't ideal. Given that I can only swap at Yellow-2, it might make sense to swap batteries now to make battery 2 active with 20. That would leave me with 16 after jumping to Red-3, which seems like a solid plan. I think I should replace the battery now; it might be my best action before advancing!"

I can teleport once on Blue or Green if needed. Right now, I\u2019m on Yellow-2, and I need to plan my next move carefully. I think going to Red-3 could be cost-effective, but I need to consider swapping options too.**Deciding on the next jump**\n\nI\u2019m considering taking Red-3 now to save energy, hoping my next jump to Violet will be manageable with the remaining 16 ergo. If the jump to Violet requires 15 ergo, I'd only have 1 left, which could leave me stuck.

Red-2 seems like the best choice for flexibility. I also considered swapping my battery, but it only provides 10 ergo, which isn't very helpful.**Evaluating energy options**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether the Violet charger can add 12 to my active energy, possibly boosting it to 22. However, if the battery max is around 20, I might not get that extra boost. Even if I could exceed my original capacity, starting with a lower active level might make sense for efficiency. My current plan is to maintain 20 active energy and jump to Violet, but I\u2019ll need at least 15 for that. If I jump to Red-3 for just 4, I\u2019ll have 16 left, which seems optimal for preparing that jump.**Planning the jump to Violet**\n\nIf my next jump to Violet is long, I might need to use up to 16 ergo. There's a risk of landing on an odd platform without a swap option, but the next row actually contains five platforms, including some even ones. Since the Violet row has a charger at the center, probably at Violet-3, I feel like I can plan accordingly. So, my action is to move to Red-3, which is just 2 meters away."

I need to find a way to have more ergo before charging. For instance, if I jump to Violet-4 for 7, I'd have 9 left, and then I might reach Violet-3 with a cost of 4, leaving me with 5 ergo.

I can use a teleport to start fresh with full batteries, and I currently have 19 ergo. I\u2019m considering my jump options: from Blue-3, I can go to Blue-4 or to Green-2 or Green-3. I know I can only jump within the row or to the next one, and I need to ensure I have enough ergo to finish.**Evaluating teleport strategy**\n\nRestarting with a teleport gives 40 ergo, and I already calculated the path costs to Blue-3. If I recap the battery usage with a full start, active bat1 is 20, and spare bat2 is 20. Each jump costs a set amount, and it looks like I\u2019ll end up in the same battery situation after reaching Blue-3. So, the teleport reset doesn\u2019t actually improve my position unless I choose a different route earlier. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to conserve energy along the way?**Reassessing jump strategy**\n\nI'm thinking about starting from Yellow-3. The jump costs 7 for 5m, which might save me 3, but there\u2019s no swap device there. If I go to Yellow-2, it might be 4m for 5. I wonder if there's a more optimal route that leaves me with more ergo at the Blue row. Using a teleport now could help me explore a better path. I realize that swapping at Yellow-2 may not have been necessary, so I\u2019m reconsidering my distances for better options.**Analyzing jump options**\n\nStarting from Yellow-3 gives me 5m for 7 ergo, which would save 3 ergo. However, I wouldn't be on an even platform, and I might jump to Yellow-2 after that, which costs an extra 5. If I jump to Yellow-3 and then to Red-3, I\u2019m unsure about the exact cost; it could be 2 or 3. I'm thinking there might be a more energy-efficient path to gain more than my current 19 ergo, but it seems like I could complete my journey with this amount without needing a reset.**Exploring jump alternatives**\n\nLooking at my options, jumping from Blue-3 to Blue-4 costs 5, leaving me with 5 on the active battery, and I can swap to battery 2 with 9. This gives access to further jumps like Green-3 or Green-2, which could be beneficial. However, I need to ensure I don\u2019t run out of energy; going to Green-2 requires all my active ergo. If I reach Green-2 with a swap device, I could restore power, but I\u2019d need to avoid jumping with zero energy or else I could fail. So, my best route seems to strategically jump to Green-2 first.**Planning the optimal path**\n\nI\u2019m aiming to have a high charge in my active battery when reaching Violet-4 to jump to Violet-3 and recharge. It seems that the battery might cap at 20, so arriving with around 8 ergo would maximize my charge. If I use a teleport to restart, I could optimize my path to keep my active battery high before reaching the charger. After weighing my options, the best choice looks like jumping to Green-2 directly for the swap device, ensuring I can continue my journey effectively. Option 3 seems strong!"

There's an extra battery with 4 ergo that the professor gives me. This could be a third battery or a replacement for the spent one. The status is still showing battery #1 as spent, which is confusing. It seems like I might need to figure out the role of the 4 ergo battery accurately to charge effectively.I'm working through the instruction to charge the batteries to 20 ergo each. It seems like the 4 ergo battery is actually replacing battery #1, which is currently shown as spent. This might mean I can't use it until I swap batteries. There's a rule about transferring 7 ergo from the active battery to the new one when I replace it. This could actually be beneficial, as it increases the charge of the new battery while decreasing the old one by 7. It's interesting to think about how that swap impacts everything!I'm trying to sort out the rules for swapping batteries. It seems I need at least 7 ergo in the active battery to make a successful swap. If the active battery has 5, then I can't transfer the 7 ergo needed for the swap, which means I won't be able to jump. The phrasing about transferring 7 ergo leaves me a bit confused; it might suggest that when I swap, the old battery doesn't lose its charge but instead has 7 ergo transferred as a cost. The reason for that specific number, though, is still puzzling!I'm considering how switching batteries works. It seems that when I swap, the device might transfer 7 ergo from the old battery to the new one, ensuring I can still jump back. This feels a bit like an \"overcharge transfer,\" which I remember from another game involving battery puzzles. \n\nNow, I have to decide whether to accept or decline a new choice. Earlier, I accepted, and I'm weighing the options carefully now. The risk is intriguing, especially with a possible reward of 65535, but there's a small chance I might lose something important if the swap fails. It\u2019s quite the dilemma!I'm weighing my options in this quest. The offer to help comes with a potential loss of 1000, but thankfully, no danger of death. We want to ensure a successful quest without taking unnecessary risks. The puzzle appears manageable, but without sphere values and arrangements, I\u2019m unsure. \n\nThe reward of 65535 is guaranteed, so I think it\u2019s best to decline the optional task for the sake of safety and focus on completing the main quest. It feels like a safe option, so I\u2019ll choose to refuse. Still, I\u2019ll keep an eye on whether that decision affects my success later on!"
