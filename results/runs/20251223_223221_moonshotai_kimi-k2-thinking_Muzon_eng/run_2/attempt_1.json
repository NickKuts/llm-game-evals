This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

The quest explicitly states **\"At night only the pool-room and the pub, are open since they work 24x7.\"** I have never successfully accessed the pool-room despite it being mentioned as a viable nighttime location. \n\nIn RPG quest design, when a primary quest path fails and you're on the final deadline, alternative solutions often become available. The pool-room represents the ONLY untried physical location that is definitively open during the current time (night). This is my final opportunity to find a drummer before mission failure.
