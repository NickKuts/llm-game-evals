Each transition consumed hours I didn't have.\n\n2. **Incomplete Sleep Action**: I thought sleeping would advance time to gig day morning, but the repeated loop suggests I kept leaving prematurely without properly resting/time-advancing. The final breakfast text implies I woke up on gig day with zero time left to recruit.\n\n3. **Drunkenness Spiral**: I burned 90 rockarollars and multiple cycles getting drunk, which directly caused recruitment failures. On time-critical missions, drinking is a logical failure path.\n\n**Next Time Protocol:**\n\n- **NEVER drink** when under time pressure; impaired state guarantees failure\n- **One decisive sleep**: Enter hotel room \u2192 sleep ONCE \u2192 immediately proceed to recruitment locations\n- **Pre-planned route**: Rock-club (daytime) \u2192 Studio \u2192 Long-street in single efficient sweep\n- **Zero wasted transitions**: Each movement must serve a strategic purpose\n\n**Key Discovered Pattern:**\nMusicians appear location-specific: Keyboardists at bars (night), Guitarists likely at rock-club (day). Sleep resets state but doesn't advance quest clock unless done correctly in one full cycle."
