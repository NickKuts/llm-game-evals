This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

Sleeping is the optimal strategic reset: it will advance time to morning (0 days left), making me SOBER again (critical for successful recruitment), and unlock daytime-only locations like the rock-club (most likely guitarist source), studio, and long street. With 342 rockarollars, I have sufficient funds for recruitment fees.

  "failure_reflection": "**Critical Strategic Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Time Mismanagement**: I wasted 8+ precious cycles (steps 109-117) in a square\u2192hotel loop while having only 1 day left. Each transition consumed hours I didn't have.\n\n2. **Incomplete Sleep Action**: I thought sleeping would advance time to gig day morning, but the repeated loop suggests I kept leaving prematurely without properly resting/time-advancing. The final breakfast text implies I woke up on gig day with zero time left to recruit.\n\n3. **Drunkenness Spiral**: I burned 90 rockarollars and multiple cycles getting drunk, which directly caused recruitment failures. On time-critical missions, drinking is a logical failure path.\n\n**Next Time Protocol:**\n\n- **NEVER drink** when under time pressure; impaired state guarantees failure\n- **One decisive sleep**: Enter hotel room \u2192 sleep ONCE \u2192 immediately proceed to recruitment locations\n- **Pre-planned route**: Rock-club (daytime) \u2192 Studio \u2192 Long-street in single efficient sweep\n- **Zero wasted transitions**: Each movement must serve a strategic purpose\n\n**Key Discovered Pattern:**\nMusicians appear location-specific: Keyboardists at bars (night), Guitarists likely at rock-club (day). Sleep resets state but doesn't advance quest clock unless done correctly in one full cycle."
