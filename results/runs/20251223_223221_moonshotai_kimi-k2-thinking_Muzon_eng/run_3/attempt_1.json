This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

In quest design, neutral \"wait\" options often lead to missed triggers or failure. The post-performance phase wasn't filler\u2014it was the final opportunity to influence quest completion.\n\n2. **What to do differently**: Always choose active options after key tasks: talk to audience, give interviews, or scout competitors. These actions typically provide intelligence, influence victory conditions, or trigger necessary NPC interactions that passive waiting bypasses.\n\n3. **Discovered patterns**:\n   - Member ratings are absolute: \"suck\" = guaranteed failure when featured; \"good\" = reliable success\n   - My singing is the highest-value asset\u2014use it when in doubt\n   - Audience appraisal is the critical metric; protect it by never featuring unreliable members\n   - Risk management trumps potential rewards when time is short\n\nThe logical error was treating performance as the entire objective rather than recognizing that completion required proactive post-show actions."
