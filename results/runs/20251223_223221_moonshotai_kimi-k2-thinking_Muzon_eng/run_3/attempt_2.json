This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

This is the most direct recruitment opportunity I've seen. \"Approach the man\" (choice 2) is the active option that directly addresses my primary mission objective. The bar table option (choice 1) might lead to a random encounter with a drunken Peleng, which is less likely to yield a qualified band member. Going back to the square (choice 3) would be retreating from an active recruitment opportunity, repeating the exact logical error that caused my previous failure. I must aggressively pursue every potential musician, and this bass player is performing live, demonstrating his abilities. Even if he declines or asks for payment, I need to initiate this conversation to assess my options and potentially trigger other game events.",

Drinking doesn't advance recruitment; it creates a death spiral. I also failed to recognize that approaching the bass player while drunk was guaranteed to fail due to my impaired state.\n\n2. **Different Approach Next Time:** **NEVER drink more than once.** A single drink might be social lubricant, but multiple drinks = quest failure. When hammered, immediately leave the bar and return when sober. Prioritize active recruitment over passive bar activities. The bass player is a dead end when drunk; instead, try the Peleng or leave for the rock-club immediately.\n\n3. **Key Information Discovered:** Night at the pub offers two potential recruits: a bass guitarist (stage) and a drunken Peleng (bar table). The robot bartender sells cheap beer (30 rockarollars), but it's a trap\u2014each drink progressively impairs you. The optimal path is: enter \u2192 single targeted interaction \u2192 if no success, immediately leave to pool-room or rock-club. Time is the real currency here, not rockarollars."
