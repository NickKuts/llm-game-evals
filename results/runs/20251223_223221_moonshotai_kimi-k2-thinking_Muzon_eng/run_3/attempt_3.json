This year they are celebrating their 300 anniversary, so it is very important for us that we win. This year's winner will be remembered forever in history! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band that we planned to put on the bill this year, got into jail because of a stupid drug-incident. We need to find a replacement and soon. We heard that you were a good singer, and back in your younger years were even playing some hyper-rock band. This is why we have chosen you, ranger Ranger. According to our estimates you have a couple of days left to complete the line-up for the band. Of course this is not enough time, but there will be a whole lot of musicians at the festival, and we expect that you will be able to sign them in. We will mail you some other details later. \r\n\r\nThe mission budget is 1200 rockarollars - that's the local currency - which you will receive in the hotel. We are also paying all of your accommodation expenses. Oh yes, and before I forgot, you must be on the planet of Bonnasis not later than 6 February 3000. Good luck!",

The laptop successfully found my bass-player previously, proving it's the most direct recruitment tool. Despite recent \"no musicians available\" results (which may have been a temporary cooldown), I must continue active recruitment - my failure analysis explicitly warns that passive waiting guarantees failure. I can afford 16+ more searches at 5 rockarollars each. Options 2-4 are passive activities that waste critical time. Option 5 would exit to physical locations that have proven unreliable and time-consuming. Continuing the musician search is aggressive, targeted action that directly addresses my mission-critical gaps while I still have time and resources. This is my only viable path to assembling a functional band before tomorrow's gig.\n\nACTION: 1",

However, my core strategic principle remains: **aggressive action > passive paralysis**.\n\n\"To the main square\" is the only option that provides any possibility\u2014however remote\u2014of eventually accessing recruitment locations.

I cannot afford ANY musician found (previous costs: 200, 300, 400).\n\n2. **Temporal**: \"Very sleepy!!!\" status means forced sleep is imminent - likely 1 action remaining before sleep triggers automatically.\n\n3. **Resource depletion**: I started with 62 rockarollars and have spent 58 on searches, bleeding money on a proven unaffordable path. I have NOT accessed other laptop functions (Library, Mailbox, Instrument search) that might contain solutions.\n\n4. **Strategic error**: I have a SUCK-rated keyboardist who guarantees failure if featured (per my failure analysis), yet I haven't accessed any function to fire them.\n\n**Critical decision**: Continuing to search is mathematically irrational - even if I find a 100 rockarollar musician, I cannot afford it (4 rockarollars). The \"very sleepy\" warning means I must maximize my final action.
