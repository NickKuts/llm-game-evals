But the grotto seems promising, although past attempts ended poorly. There's randomness involved \u2014 maybe we just need to keep trying. I wonder if heading east again makes sense since it feels consistent. But I also think exploring the mountains might lead to a better base instead of getting stuck in the grotto.**Considering strategies for engagement**\n\nI'm wondering if we were attacked and had to retreat, leaving us a bit wounded. Should I give the forest another try? There was a cabin there, but I couldn\u2019t find it. I need to be cautious about spooking Borzukhan, as repeated searches might alert him. The cabin in the western woods possibly connects to the coast, which could be our escape route. It might be smart to search for the cabin and then block the coast, but I'm thinking we should also scout around the camp for more clues or maybe find medkits, even if there's no store.**Weighing options for recovery**\n\nConsidering my wounded state, I think it's smarter to circle around the camp to look for anything suspicious or perhaps encounter someone who can help me heal. This approach seems low risk and provides an opportunity to gather new clues without alarming Borzukhan. The other areas might be more dangerous, so it feels like I should prioritize gathering intel first. Plus, getting close to medical help could be crucial. I\u2019m ready to take action!"

Prefer controlled laser fire from the flyer/cover, or lure small groups out and thin them safely.\n- If I do use an explosive, reposition and wait/observe before entering; be ready to retreat rather than walk into an alerted corridor.\n- Save grenades for truly unavoidable emergencies in open areas, not narrow tunnels.\n\nInfo learned:\n- The northern mountains cave is a valid base entrance.\n- Using a grenade at the entrance triggers immediate guard mobilization deeper inside."
