That ignored an obvious risk: the window could be **too thick/armored**, could **block/deflect a stunner discharge**, or could be **wired/alarmed**, instantly turning a perfect ambush into a lethal close-range counterattack. I also didn\u2019t account for **escape routes** (back door/hatch) or set up positioning to **cover exits** before initiating contact.\n\n2. **What to do differently next time:** Treat the cabin as a trap zone. **Recon the perimeter first** (doors, back exits, chimneys, possible guards, alarm wires). Then capture via a **controlled entry**: get to the door silently, open/peek, stun at **point-blank** (no glass), or rush in while maintaining cover and having the laser ready as a backup. Ideally **block/cover exits** before acting so he can\u2019t flee.\n\n3. **Important info discovered:** Borzukhan regularly sits alone in a **cabin in the western woods**; pirates mentioned a **secret passage to the coast**; I recovered **extra laser charges** and a **nearly empty stunner (1\u20132 shots)**."
