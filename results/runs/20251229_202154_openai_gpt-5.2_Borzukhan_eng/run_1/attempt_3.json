There are three likely places to consider: a coastal grotto, a northern mountain cave, and a forest cabin where Borzukhan is found. The main goal is to destroy a base, which could be in the mountains or caves. Carl suggested looking at the mountains north, the forest southwest, or the underground caves via the east grotto. I also need to think about the search order and my limited supplies, wanting to maintain stealth. Recon could help, but it might take time, so I need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully.**Weighing options for the mission**\n\nI could start by heading southwest to find Borzukhan's cabin and capture him without triggering alarms, then focus on destroying the base later. However, if the base isn't in the forest, capturing him might not be essential, but I shouldn't let him escape either. There's a risk that if I handle the base first and he gets away, it could lead to failure. Borzukhan often isolates himself, making capturing him easier at his cabin, but I also have to keep the base destruction in mind, as I might encounter him there too. Balancing these objectives is tricky.**Evaluating the capture strategy**\n\nIf the cabin is where Borzukhan stays, capturing him early could lessen future resistance and prevent his escape. But then, I wonder who might be at the base? He might be there sometimes. In my previous notes, I found him alone in the cabin. If I manage to capture or eliminate him, I can proceed to the base and plant explosives without worrying about him running away. Still, I need to be careful this time; my last attempt failed because I acted too rashly. Using a flyer for recon could help locate the base, but it might be well-hidden. Circling the area could help me spot smoke or trails, which makes option 2 seem safer and could yield useful information. I should also consider the timing\u2014though there\u2019s no indication of a timer, so maybe I have more time than I think.**Planning the reconnaissance approach**\n\nI think I should start by circling over the camp to look for any signs of the mountains, forest, coast, or even any suspicious spots. I need to remember my past mistakes, like wasting time exploring a dead-end grotto; I need to commit more quickly to the mountains this time.

But I have to consider the mission priority of destroying the base and capturing Borzukhan, rather than just rescuing the prisoner. The risk of attacking with only limited resources complicates things.**Analyzing options for engagement**\n\nChoosing to fly away could mean leaving the prisoner with the pirates as they head to their base, but I might be able to follow them to locate it later. However, the option to fly away suggests not pursuing them right now. Knowing the cabin's location might allow for an ambush against Borzukhan. Capturing him could help lead us to the base instead of risking engagement with the pirates right now. Still, if they know we're coming, they might increase security, which is risky.**Weighing options for engagement**\n\nWithout a stunner, I\u2019m left with a laser gun, which is likely lethal. Capturing the prisoner alive could be tough since it's not mentioned that we have a stunner. In previous quests, laser guns typically kill, but perhaps I could stun in some scenarios. Rescuing the prisoner could provide valuable info about the base's weak spots, although their specific location is still unknown. Since attacking five pirates is risky and could waste resources, I need to think carefully about whether to engage or retreat.**Deciding on engagement strategy**\n\nI\u2019m considering that flying away might maintain stealth and preserve resources, but it might also look like an obvious failure. Leaving the prisoner for delivery could complicate things later, yet the mission's focus is on destroying the base, not on rescuing him. I need to avoid any rushed engagement based on past failures, so flying away seems like the best option. Maybe I can still follow from a distance without raising alarms. The plan is to head to the cabin to capture Borzukhan safely and later deal with the base.**Planning for a careful approach**\n\nI need to reflect on my previous attempt, which involved a rushed cabin capture from the window.

With my ammo state, \u201center the door\u201d is basically gambling everything on grenades and luck. Going left or right risks running into more guards and getting stuck deeper with no shots left. Going back to the exit without accomplishing the objective throws away the progress I\u2019ve bought with health and equipment damage.\n\nThe mission\u2019s primary win condition is to destroy the base by placing the special explosive at the weak spot and leaving to detonate safely. Since \u201cSet the explosive and leave\u201d is available right here, this strongly indicates I\u2019m at (or close enough to) the required weak point. Given my critical resource shortage and the presence of enemies nearby, the optimal, least-risk route to mission success is to plant the charge now and immediately withdraw, avoiding unnecessary combat and preserving my last grenade(s) for covering a retreat if needed.\n\nACTION: 2",

The game suggests there's a weak spot, possibly near the ramification area or control room. With limited ammo, grenades might be useful to clear the room. It's tempting to act immediately, but I have to prioritize survival post-explosion. Given the low resources and my injuries, avoiding combat seems best, so choice two appears to be the way to go.**Crafting reasoning**\n\nI'm analyzing the situation. We're likely near a structural weak point, possibly behind a door. Engaging with people behind the door is risky since they could raise an alarm. If I go left or right, it could lead to fights. However, retreating without placing the explosive means wasting time and progress. So, I should set the explosive, then retreat to the exit and detonate it when it's safe. \n\n**ACTION:** Set explosives and retreat."
