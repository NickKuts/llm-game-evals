If you agree, you will have to go to the planet of Bonnasis within 35 days. We already have a camp deployed on the planet, where our agents who will brief you on the mission will meet you.

As you have probably been told already, your objective here is to locate and destroy a secret Peleng base, known as Lyakusha Borzukhan. The main thing is to destroy the base. At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

I should focus on locating and destroying the base while aiming to capture Borzukhan if possible. Based on earlier attempts, I have notes indicating Borzukhan isolates in a cabin in the western woods, which is easy to find, and there's also a secret passage on the eastern coast that leads to underground caves and notes a weak spot. I need to use this information effectively!**Planning reconnaissance**\n\nIf I head to the forest, there's a good chance I\u2019ll find Borzukhan in the cabin and get clues about the base location. But if the base is in underground caves, there's a possibility he stays at the cabin as a decoy. I\u2019m thinking about doing some aerial reconnaissance first to spot trails or exits, though it might be time-consuming. Still, circling the camp could help me identify features and smoke without too much risk of being seen. It\u2019s important to gather information before deciding on our next steps!**Deciding on the approach**\n\nReconnaissance is usually helpful, but I\u2019m concerned about jumping into an immediate encounter. My notes suggest that the cabin is in the western woods, confirming that the southwest forest route is likely correct. I really want to avoid scaring Borzukhan, and using a flyer could make noise, alerting him if I land too close. Going to the east sea grotto seems like a possibility, but I think it\u2019s better to start with reconnaissance around the camp to assess tracks. I\u2019ll focus on heading to the forest; it provides the most concrete lead!"

It makes more sense to inspect the rocks carefully to find the grotto. I need to stay stealthy and avoid triggering any unwanted situations. So, I'll choose to avoid entering the water and focus on conserving my energy."

I\u2019m considering heading east to the sea since it feels like the best choice. Alternatively, circling over the camp might reveal something useful. However, I think returning to the grotto could be crucial since it seems like the main focus. So I\u2019ll choose to go east.**Choosing a clear path**\n\nI need to reason through our options. We\u2019ve confirmed the grotto to the east as our only solid lead, while the forest didn\u2019t help and caused wounds. The mountains are still a mystery, and circling over the camp doesn\u2019t seem to move us forward. So, all things considered, I\u2019m deciding to head east again. This feels like the right choice!

Entering the grotto seems promising, but I\u2019m injured. Retreating to the flyer doesn\u2019t seem like progress. I remember that at Step 18, entering the grotto led to something, but we might have triggered an ambush. It might be wiser to heal first at camp, but our choices are limited. I wonder if flying back to camp would be a good idea despite being only slightly wounded.**Deciding on action**\n\nI realized that we went to camp for medical help earlier, but I'm still wounded, so it seems that camp can only heal to a certain extent. It makes me think we might need a medkit for full recovery. Leaving for camp doesn't seem beneficial, making entering the grotto a logical choice. I should conserve grenades and keep the laser ready while proceeding slowly. Alright, I\u2019ll choose action number 1."

If exploring yielded nothing, I might need to check out other locations, like the mountains to the north. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into bases in the east and west before, but I think I\u2019ll try the mountains next.**Considering exploration strategy**\n\nI\u2019m concerned that I might be missing a crucial step, causing us to repeat loops. Maybe to enter the grotto, I needed to land and walk, which we did since we found the grotto and then returned to the flyer. But it seemed like we didn't yield any results. So now, I think I should head to the mountains. Let's decide on that as my next action!"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Evaluating options in the cave**\n\nOkay, I'm weighing our options since we're in a cave corridor with a large group approaching. We have one grenade and a laser gun. I want to proceed without abandoning our mission, so I've got to think carefully.\n\nI can retreat to hide, shoot back, or throw the grenade. While retreating seems like a fallback, it could be strategic. However, leaving might mean we lose our chance to destroy the base. On the other hand, staying and shooting could turn into a choke point advantage, but there's a risk of being overwhelmed.**Considering grenade usage**\n\nI'm thinking about using the grenade to quickly eliminate a large group, but it feels precious since it's our last one. I should save it for a potential weak spot later, but right now, it\u2019s about survival. However, throwing it in the cave could risk a collapse, which isn\u2019t ideal. \n\nHiding behind a rock outside might be a smarter option. It lets us pick off the approaching group without the grenade's risk, giving us cover while still trying to avoid getting hurt.**Evaluating options in a tight situation**\n\nIf the enemy group is close, then using the grenade could be really effective, since a large crowd would mean laser shots might not cut it. However, retreating could expose me to gunfire. Running out and hiding behind a rock could provide cover for a fight.\n\nI\u2019ve already used a grenade before, so I\u2019m weighing its strategic impact. It might be better to retreat and create a chokepoint to shoot safely as they exit rather than risk the grenade. I'll consider each option carefully.**Analyzing tactical options**\n\nFor Option 2, shooting back in the corridor might leave me exposed, as there\u2019d be no cover. I could shoot quickly, but taking hits is a real risk. \n\nIn Option 3, throwing a grenade into the crowd could cause heavy casualties, but I'd need to ensure I\u2019m at a safe distance to avoid injury. The group is still at some distance, which is promising. \n\nOpting to run out and hide (Option 1) could let me avoid direct fire, but there's a chance they might shoot me while I run. \n\nSince my goal is to clear the guards for the mission, using the grenade seems like the best choice. I'll thin their numbers and then use the laser for cover.**Deciding on an option**\n\nIt seems I need to make a straightforward choice here, so I'll go with Option 3. This option involves using the grenade to thin out the group, which makes sense given the situation. Since I\u2019m considering the best chance for success, using the grenade will help me manage the threat effectively. It feels like the strongest move at this moment, especially with the need to keep control of the situation. So, Option 3 it is!"

  "failure_reflection": "Key mistakes:\n- I treated grenades as the default solution. The first grenade at the cave entrance solved the immediate firefight but also raised the alarm; then I pushed deeper immediately, guaranteeing I\u2019d meet a mass response while already wounded.\n- After alerting the base, I advanced into a long corridor without setting a defensible position or planning a retreat path. I should have expected reinforcements and used the entrance/rocks to funnel enemies.\n- Earlier, I revisited the coastal grotto despite it leading to a dead end, wasting time before committing to the mountains.\n\nDo differently next time:\n- Prioritize stealth and control: if enemies appear, consider retreating to cover and picking them off at range instead of using explosives that trigger the whole garrison.\n- If an alarm is raised, don\u2019t go deeper immediately\u2014hold the chokepoint near the entrance, conserve grenades for truly unavoidable swarms, and reset the fight on favorable terrain.\n- Commit sooner to the northern mountains; the detected cave is the strongest lead.\n\nInfo learned:\n- Coastal grotto path can dead-end.\n- Northern mountain cave is guarded; loud actions attract large Peleng groups quickly."
