I don\u2019t know their timeline, but they might lead me directly to the base. If I leave now, following them from the air could be an option, but it\u2019s unclear. The challenge is whether to fight to rescue the prisoner.

My first thought is to use the stunner through the window, but I worry about the glass blocking its effectiveness. In some scenarios, it seems that it\u2019s worked before, though. Stepping away from the window could lead to an alternative action, but it\u2019s a limited option. I think capturing him aligns best with the mission, so I'll go with option 3.  \n\n**REASONING: Stunner through window offers best chance with reduced risk**  \n**ACTION 3**"

  "failure_reflection": "REASONING: Key mistake: I rushed the capture the moment I saw Borzukhan, acting from a risky position (outside at the window) without first securing a safe takedown angle, checking for traps/guards, or controlling escape routes. Even if he looked alone, the cabin could have alarms, hidden weapons, or a quick line of fire back through the window; \u201capparently didn\u2019t notice\u201d isn\u2019t the same as \u201chelpless.\u201d I also didn\u2019t plan the post-stun sequence (entry, binding, disabling communications) before committing.\n\nNext time: treat the cabin like a hostile structure. Recon all sides, identify exits, pick a controlled entry point (door/back door), get close cover, then stun from point-blank or from the doorway with immediate follow-up (rush in, disarm, restrain). If possible, set up to prevent escape (position by exits). Only use lethal force if capture fails.\n\nImportant info found: Borzukhan isolates in a cabin in the western woods (easy to locate via orientation points). Alternative lead remains: secret passage on the eastern coast into underground caves/base, with mention of a \u201cweak spot\u201d in the base structure.\n\nACTION: 1"
