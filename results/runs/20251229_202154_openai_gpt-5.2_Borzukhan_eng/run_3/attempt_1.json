  "failure_reflection": "REASONING: Main logical mistake: I committed to the \u201cstun him through the window\u201d takedown without accounting for basic tactics\u2014glass can distort/stop a stunner shot, and peeking at point\u2011blank range leaves zero cover or retreat if the first shot fails. With a dangerous target, \u201cone shot should do it\u201d is not a plan; I should have assumed the stunner might misfire, be blocked, or only partially incapacitate, and that Borzukhan could react instantly with a weapon.\n\nNext time: keep hard cover and a safe angle. Scout the cabin perimeter for exits/guards, then set an ambush at the door or when he steps outside. If engaging indoors, open the door from the side, shoot the stunner from cover at close range, and be ready to follow up immediately (second stunner shot or laser) while staying protected. Don\u2019t expose myself at a window with no protection.\n\nUseful intel found: Borzukhan often isolates in a cabin in the western woods (easy to locate via orientation points). Base rumors mention mountains to the north and a secret coastal passage to the east. Looting pirates gave extra laser charges and a near\u2011empty stunner (1\u20132 shots).  \n\nACTION: 1"
