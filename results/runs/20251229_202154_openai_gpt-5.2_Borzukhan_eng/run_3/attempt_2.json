We're in the west woods with some orientation points, but not everything is explicit. The pirates have a stunned prisoner heading to their base. If I choose to fly away, I preserve stealth, but I might lose the chance to rescue the prisoner. The laser could be useful, but I also have grenades available. My mission is to destroy the base and ideally capture Borzukhan alive.**Analyzing options for ambush**\n\nKnowing the cabin location makes capturing Borzukhan easier, especially since I could ambush him away from the base. Still, I need to find and destroy the base. If the pirates are headed there, it's probably better to follow them instead of attacking now. I could fly away and tail them, but leaving the Earth human prisoner might not be great. I wonder if I can neutralize the pirates quietly using the laser, though I need to be careful about being seen.**Considering strategy for capturing Borzukhan**\n\nI need to weigh the options here: capturing the pirates alive isn't feasible. I could use the laser to eliminate them, saving the prisoner and preventing his delivery to the base, but that might mean I miss the chance to track the base. We know the cabin's location, and it seems likely the forest to the southwest could be near the base. If I capture Borzukhan at the cabin, he might provide intel on the base, but I have to be careful not to alert the pirates or the base by attacking now.**Exploring options for engagement**\n\nIf I decide to fly away and leave the pirates, I could later intercept Borzukhan at the cabin without the base expecting it. However, the prisoner will likely be taken to the base and could face dire consequences. As a ranger, I might want to rescue him, but it\u2019s not mandatory. I\u2019m considering flying away to avoid immediate action and then following them from above to find the base. But since the options seem limited, I\u2019m unsure if flying away triggers a follow-up action. It\u2019s all quite complex!**Strategizing engagement approach**\n\nBased on the game logic, if there's no option to follow, \"fly away\" might just mean leaving the area. However, later steps could let me track the pirates if I observe their direction. I want to let them lead me to the base, but I shouldn't engage right now. Maybe I can fly away and keep an eye on them from the air. The laser seems like the best choice since it allows for stealthy shots while minimizing risk to the prisoner.

I have several choices: knock politely, go back, sneak a look, kick the door, or use a grenade. The goal is to capture Borzukhan alive, and I have a stunner for 1-2 shots.

I really need to weigh the risks carefully.**Deciding on action**\n\nI think it\u2019s better to knock on the door while keeping to the side, stunner ready. The options don\u2019t describe positioning, but I can assume I can be strategic about it. In games, knocking politely often leads to a conversation or an opportunity to attack. Kicking the door in might initiate combat, which I want to avoid since I'm trying to capture him alive. Also, looking through the window is too risky. So, knocking seems like the best action!"

Knocking and then standing in a predictable spot at the door gave the defender full initiative: he could aim through the peephole/door, decide to ambush, or slip out a back exit while I was \u201cnegotiating.\u201d I also failed to do proper reconnaissance (circle the cabin, locate back door/windows, check for tracks/alarms, pick a covered angle) before contact, and I didn\u2019t set up a controlled capture plan (position off-axis, weapon ready, immediate stun/entry).\n\n**Do differently next time:** Before any contact, scout the entire cabin perimeter, identify escape routes, and choose a covered approach. If knocking, do it from the side of the doorway (not in the line of the peephole) with the stunner/laser already aimed at the door crack; be ready to rush and stun the moment it opens. Consider a fast, decisive entry to deny him time to react/escape.\n\n**Useful info learned:** Borzukhan isolates in a western-woods cabin; killing the patrol yielded extra laser charges and a nearly-depleted stunner (1\u20132 shots).  \n\nACTION: 1"
