With a dangerous target, \u201cone shot should do it\u201d is not a plan; I should have assumed the stunner might misfire, be blocked, or only partially incapacitate, and that Borzukhan could react instantly with a weapon.\n\nNext time: keep hard cover and a safe angle. Scout the cabin perimeter for exits/guards, then set an ambush at the door or when he steps outside. If engaging indoors, open the door from the side, shoot the stunner from cover at close range, and be ready to follow up immediately (second stunner shot or laser) while staying protected. Don\u2019t expose myself at a window with no protection.\n\nUseful intel found: Borzukhan often isolates in a cabin in the western woods (easy to locate via orientation points). Base rumors mention mountains to the north and a secret coastal passage to the east. Looting pirates gave extra laser charges and a near\u2011empty stunner (1\u20132 shots).  \n\nACTION: 1"

      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: **Strategic mistakes:** I treated the cabin approach like a conversation instead of a hostage/arrest situation. Knocking and then standing in a predictable spot at the door gave the defender full initiative: he could aim through the peephole/door, decide to ambush, or slip out a back exit while I was \u201cnegotiating.\u201d I also failed to do proper reconnaissance (circle the cabin, locate back door/windows, check for tracks/alarms, pick a covered angle) before contact, and I didn\u2019t set up a controlled capture plan (position off-axis, weapon ready, immediate stun/entry).\n\n**Do differently next time:** Before any contact, scout the entire cabin perimeter, identify escape routes, and choose a covered approach. If knocking, do it from the side of the doorway (not in the line of the peephole) with the stunner/laser already aimed at the door crack; be ready to rush and stun the moment it opens. Consider a fast, decisive entry to deny him time to react/escape.\n\n**Useful info learned:** Borzukhan isolates in a western-woods cabin; killing the patrol yielded extra laser charges and a nearly-depleted stunner (1\u20132 shots).  \n\nACTION: 1"
