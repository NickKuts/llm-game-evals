Our options feel limited. I wonder if we should attack with a grenade or laser, or just fly away. Fleeing without action doesn\u2019t seem wise, especially since the pirates might leave danger behind. Attacking could risk alerting the base, but it could also help us rescue the prisoner or gather loot. I guess we only have our laser and grenades right now.**Weighing options on combat**\n\nI\u2019m really considering the risks of open combat. If we leave the pirates with the prisoner, that could lead to the prisoner\u2019s death and an alerted base. Our mission is to prevent Borzukhan from escaping, but do the pirates know we\u2019re here? If we attack, survivors might report us. It\u2019s intriguing to think about going directly to the cabin in the woods instead; it seems like a stealthier option for capturing Borzukhan and locating the base without unnecessary conflict.**Considering the cabin strategy**\n\nThe cabin presents a good opportunity to capture Borzukhan away from the base, which seems easier. But I\u2019m wrestling with a moral dilemma about the human prisoner; what\u2019s our mission priority? If we save him, it might help, especially if he\u2019s an Earth agent. However, letting the pirates take him could complicate things later. Given our options, it seems the game is nudging us to attack the pirates for their stunner and ammo, which aligns with earlier notes. It looks like eliminating them efficiently and quietly would be best, using our laser carefully.**Planning the attack strategy**\n\nI\u2019m deciding that using the laser gun is the best option to ambush the pirates from our rock cover. Since we can't choose to rescue the prisoner, our approach will be to eliminate the pirates instead. I\u2019ll pick the laser over a grenade due to the risks of noise and collateral damage, plus I want to save grenades for dealing with the base and its guards. I'll focus on attacking the pirates farthest from the prisoner to avoid any accidents and then loot for the stunner afterward. Let's prepare this response!"

We find ourselves in a hidden, dimly lit room with corridors leading left and right, plus a door with sounds of voices. Our objective is to destroy the base using a remote explosive at its weakest point, which we still need to locate. Setting the explosive and leaving might be risky without knowing where the weak spot is. It\u2019s important to explore first, but guards and alarms could pose a problem.**Weighing dangers and options**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it might be risky to check the door with voices, but it could lead to valuable intel or access to other areas of the base. The corridors to the left and right are unknown, and the main exit is in front of me. Exploring those side paths first could help locate structural weak points, like in power or ventilation systems. I\u2019m considering starting with the left or right corridor, while keeping stealth in mind and avoiding unnecessary encounters.**Exploring corridors and options**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that just planting an explosive might not be enough to collapse the base. To avoid immediate confrontation, I\u2019ll go in the opposite direction from the voices and choose a corridor\u2014right feels like a practical choice, even if I don't have a solid reason. I also need to conserve our laser charges, as we only have six left. Heading toward the light could lead us to the main exit, but I need to find a key structural point for sabotage. Exploring is essential to figure this out!**Considering corridor choices**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which corridor might lead to the reactor. It could be either left or right, but that feels random. I\u2019m wondering if one side leads to the armory with guards and the other to the base\u2019s core. The door with voices might be a guard room, providing an opportunity to surprise them. Since we\u2019ve already captured someone, the base could be lightly guarded, but I need to consider the risk of triggering an alarm. Gathering intel could help me find the weak point I need to sabotage.**Deciding on exploration tactics**\n\nI'm weighing my options: I could choose left or right to find a weak point while avoiding confrontation. However, it's likely that the base is occupied. Gathering info from any nearby people could help me locate essential structures, like a support column. It\u2019s unclear if I still have a charged stunner, and opting for lethal force might be necessary instead. The explosives should be placed at the weak area, possibly near the hidden door by the cave wall.
