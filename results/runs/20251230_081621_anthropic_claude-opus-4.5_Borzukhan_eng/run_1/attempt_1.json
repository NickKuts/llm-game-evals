At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

Circling over the camp might give me a better view of the surroundings and potentially spot something useful. Carl did say to keep my eyes open.\n\nOn the other hand, I could just pick one of the three locations and start investigating. The question is which one to try first?\n\nLet me think strategically:\n- Mountains in the north - could be a good hiding spot\n- Forest in the south-west - natural cover\n- Caves in the east by the sea - underground, secretive\n\nFor a \"secret base,\" underground caves seem like a classic choice for secrecy.

They could be innocent locals, travelers, or something else entirely. Killing them without knowing who they are would be reckless and potentially harmful to my mission.

Landing right by them gives me no tactical advantage.\n\n3. Land carefully not far from the fire - This is more cautious. I can observe them from a safer distance before making contact. This allows me to assess the situation without being immediately in danger.\n\n4. Fly closer to the fire and shoot from the laser gun - Same problem as option 1 - I don't know who these creatures are. Shooting at unknown targets is reckless.\n\n5. Turn back and fly away - This would mean abandoning this lead. The smoke was suspicious and worth investigating. Flying away without learning anything would waste the opportunity.\n\nThe smartest approach is option 3 - land carefully not far from the fire. This allows me to:\n- Approach cautiously on foot\n- Observe who they are before making contact\n- Have better tactical positioning if they turn out to be hostile\n- Not waste my limited resources (grenades, laser charges) on potentially innocent creatures\n\nI should not attack without knowing who they are. They could be:\n- Peleng base guards (enemies)\n- Local inhabitants (neutral/friendly)\n- Other travelers\n- A trap\n\nOption 3 is the most tactically sound choice - gather more information before acting."

I've hit the jackpot with intelligence gathering:\n\n- Borzukhan spends time ALONE in a small cabin in the woods to the WEST\n- I now have orientation points to find this cabin easily\n- The boss is ALONE there (easier to capture than at the main base)\n\nNow I have a critical decision to make. My options:\n\n1. Throw a grenade into the pirates - This would kill/injure the pirates but would also likely kill the innocent prisoner\n2. Fly away - Leave to pursue Borzukhan at the cabin\n3. Shoot the pirates from the laser gun - Attack with laser (can be more precise, might spare the prisoner)\n\nLet me think about priorities:\n\nPRIMARY MISSION: Destroy the secret base AND capture/kill Borzukhan (preferably capture for bonus)\n\nI now know that Borzukhan is ALONE in a cabin in the western woods. This is a golden opportunity:\n- He's isolated from his guards\n- I can capture him more easily alone than at the main base\n- If I act quickly, I can get to him before these pirates return\n\nBut what about the prisoner and the pirates?\n\nIf I attack the pirates:\n- Grenade: likely kills prisoner (bad), uses one of only 2 grenades\n- Laser: can potentially be more surgical, 10 charges vs 5 pirates is manageable if I'm accurate\n- Risk: combat could go wrong, waste resources, pirates might escape and warn others\n\nIf I fly away:\n- The prisoner gets taken to the main base (bad for the prisoner)\n- The pirates continue to the base (no immediate threat to my mission)\n- I can go directly to capture Borzukhan while he's alone\n- Once I have Borzukhan, I still need to destroy the base\n\nThe main considerations:\n1. Capturing Borzukhan alone is much easier than at the base\n2. If I attack pirates, combat noise might alert others\n3. The prisoner's fate is unfortunate but my mission is about Borzukhan and the base\n\n\n4. My resources are limited - I need to decide whether to spend them here or preserve them for the main objectives\n\nCapturing Borzukhan at his isolated cabin could give me leverage to access the base or force him to reveal its defenses. The laser offers precision if I act with surprise, but grenades risk the prisoner. The strategic advantage of taking Borzukhan alone while he's vulnerable might outweigh the immediate threat to the captive.\n\nIf I abandon the prisoner now, he'll likely be transported to the base rather than executed. Completing my mission\u2014destroying the base and capturing Borzukhan\u2014could ultimately secure his freedom. Attempting a rescue here risks both of us and could compromise everything. The ranger code pulls at me, but sometimes the larger mission serves more people in the end.\n\nI have a clear shot with surprise on my side: 10 shots against 5 enemies, and if I'm fast enough, I can neutralize them before they react. But failure means combat with armed pirates and potential exposure. The real advantage is that Borzukhan is isolated right now\u2014if I don't act soon, he might return to the base where he's unreachable. Flying away preserves my resources for the main objectives and keeps my presence unknown. The prisoner survives transport; I can attempt a rescue later if the mission succeeds.\n\nHowever, letting these pirates reach the base means reinforcing it before my assault. If I can secure Borzukhan first though, I might bypass the base entirely or find leverage to avoid a direct confrontation. The window with him alone won't stay open long. I need to prioritize the isolated target while I have the chance."

Also, I only have 2 grenades and might need them for destroying the base. This option eliminates the possibility of capturing him alive.\n\n2.

There could be traps, multiple people, or Borzukhan could be armed and ready. Going in blind is risky.\n\n5.

The pirates were going to take the prisoner to \"the base\" - this is different from the cabin.\n\nSo the main base could still be at:\n- Mountains north\n- Underground caves east by the sea\n\nNow I need to decide: should I get medical help first or continue the mission?\n\nI'm wounded. If I continue without treatment, I might be in worse shape for combat at the base. \n\nHere's the tension: getting medical help takes time and risks alerting the base if they discover Borzukhan's body, but going in wounded could compromise the entire mission. I should head back to camp and get Carl's assistance to patch up before assaulting the base. Being injured in a firefight against a pirate stronghold is a serious disadvantage I can't afford."

Still, this is an improvement.\n\nNow I need to find and destroy the base. My options are:\n1. Go to the east, to the sea (underground caves via grotto)\n2. Go north, to the mountains\n\nBoth were mentioned by Carl as possible base locations. I don't have specific intel pointing to one over the other for the main base location.\n\nLet me think about what I know:\n- The pirates in the swamp were heading to \"the base\" with their prisoner\n- The swamp was in the south\n- They mentioned Borzukhan's cabin being in the western woods (which I found)\n- They didn't specifically mention where the main base is\n\nFrom the swamp (south), heading to the base... which direction would that be? I don't have clear intel on this.\n\nCarl's three possible locations were:\n1. Mountains north - possible base\n2. Forest southwest - turned out to be Borzukhan's cabin location\n3. Underground caves via grotto in the east, by the coast - possible base\n\nThe forest option isn't available anymore (probably because I already found the cabin there). So the remaining possibilities are mountains or caves.\n\nFor a \"secret base\" that needs to be destroyed by finding its \"weakest spot\" and planting explosives:\n- Underground caves would be a good hiding spot, naturally concealed\n- Mountains could also hide a base\n\nBoth are reasonable options. Without more specific intel, I'll have to make a choice. \n\nUnderground caves seem like a classic location for a secret pirate base - hidden from aerial observation, natural fortification, multiple escape routes through the cave system. The name \"Lyakusha Borzukhan\" might be a clue but I'm not sure.\n\nActually, let me think about quest logic. The forest led to the cabin (Borzukhan's hideout). The main base where the pirates operate from would be a different location. \n\n\nCaves near the coast make more tactical sense for pirates - they'd have water access for operations and smuggling, plus the natural concealment and defensible passages. Mountains are possible, but the coastal caves feel like the stronger choice for a hidden base requiring explosives to destroy. I'm heading east toward the sea."

Planting the explosive in a random corridor probably won't bring down the entire base. But I'm in rough condition with dwindling ammunition, and pushing deeper means risking more combat I might not survive. I need to balance finding the optimal detonation site against my deteriorating resources. The voices behind the door could be guards, which means engagement could drain what little firepower I have left.\n\nI should explore cautiously to locate a better target, but not at the cost of getting killed.
