At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive.

Land carefully NOT FAR from the fire - This is cautious reconnaissance. I can observe who they are before committing, and I have distance if things go bad.\n\n4. Fly closer and throw a grenade - This is aggressive. I don't know who these creatures are. They could be:\n   - Innocent civilians/locals\n   - The enemy base personnel\n   - Potential allies or informants\n   Attacking unknown targets wastes resources and could be morally wrong/fail the mission.\n\n5. Fly closer and shoot from the laser gun - Same problems as option 4. Aggressive against unknown targets.\n\nThe key issue is: I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE CREATURES ARE. Carl said there would be armed guards at the base, but this is just creatures around a fire in a swamp. They could be:\n- Peleng soldiers from the base (enemies)\n- Local swamp dwellers (could be informants or neutral)\n- Refugees or travelers\n- A trap\n\nThe smartest move is option 3 - land carefully at a distance. This allows me to:\n- Observe and identify who they are\n- Approach cautiously if they seem friendly\n- Retreat if they're hostile\n- Maintain tactical advantage\n\nOption 2 (landing right by them) is too risky - I'd be surrounded immediately.\nOptions 4 and 5 (attacking) are premature and could kill innocents or waste precious ammo.\nOption 1 (fleeing) abandons a promising lead.\n\nI'll go with option 3 - careful, cautious approach."

Rescuing him seems like the right choice both morally and tactically.\n\n\nWith the element of surprise on my side and 10 laser charges against 5 armed pirates, I have a real chance of taking them down cleanly. Two shots per target should be sufficient, especially since they won't see me coming. The grenade would be overkill and would definitely kill the prisoner. But if I just leave now with Borzukhan's location, I'd be abandoning someone who might be tortured or executed - and I'd lose a potential ally who could help me.\n\nUsing the laser makes more tactical sense: I neutralize the immediate threat, preserve my grenades for the base assault, and possibly gain an informant.
