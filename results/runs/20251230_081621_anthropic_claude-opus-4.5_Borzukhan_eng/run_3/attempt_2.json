At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

Turn back and fly away - retreat and avoid further damage\n2. Shoot the guards with laser gun - engage in combat\n3. Throw a grenade - more powerful attack but I only have 2 grenades\n\nLet me think about this strategically:\n\nFrom my previous attempt notes:\n- \"Search pirate bodies for extra ammo and stunner\" - this suggests defeating pirates yields useful loot including a STUNNER\n- The stunner is crucial for capturing Borzukhan alive (1000 cr bonus)\n- My previous attempt failed partly because I had a \"nearly-depleted\" stunner\n\nIf I fly away, I lose the chance to get the stunner and extra ammo. But if I stay and fight, I risk more damage.\n\nThe pirates are armed with laser guns and there's a GROUP of them. Using a grenade would be effective against a group, but I only have 2 and might need them later (for guards at the base, perhaps).\n\nUsing my laser gun (10 charges) seems reasonable - I have decent ammo. But engaging multiple enemies could drain my resources.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. My notes say \"Pirates by fire (500m north of camp) reveal cabin location if you LISTEN\" - these might be different pirates. The pirates with the intel might be elsewhere, not in this hostile group.\n\nBut these ARE pirates in the north, and defeating them could yield the stunner and ammo I need. The question is how to defeat them efficiently.\n\nA grenade against a GROUP of pirates makes tactical sense - it's area effect and could take out multiple enemies at once. But I only have 2 grenades and might need them at the base.\n\nThe laser gun has 10 charges - that's reasonable for dealing with a group if I'm accurate.\n\nActually, since they're already firing at me and I've taken damage, fleeing might be smart to preserve health. \n\nThe stunner is too valuable to pass up though. My last run fell apart because I was working with a depleted one, so securing a fresh one here could be the difference between success and failure. I should engage them with a grenade\u2014it'll handle the group efficiently and let me grab the equipment I need, even if it means using one of my two grenades."

  "failure_reflection": "## Reflection on Failed Attempt **Key Strategic Mistakes:** 1. **Wrong target in the mountains:** I flew to the cave assuming it was where the pirates were. The \"pirates at a fire 500m north\" are likely at a CAMPFIRE location, NOT inside a cave. The cave appears to be a hostile base entrance with guards, not an intel-gathering location. 2. **Entered cave after loud explosion:** After throwing a grenade at outside guards, I still entered the cave. This was foolish - the explosion obviously alerted all guards inside. Should have retreated after the initial firefight. 3. **Wasted resources on wrong location:** Used 1 of 2 grenades fighting guards at a location that wasn't useful for my mission objectives. **What to do differently:** - When circling mountains, look for a CAMPFIRE with pirates (not cave) - OR try going to the FOREST (southwest) first to find Borzukhan's cabin directly - The COAST (east, grotto) is likely the actual base entrance to use AFTER getting intel and capturing Borzukhan - Avoid entering hostile areas after making noise **Important Info:** - Mountains cave = hostile guards, NOT intel source - Need to find pirates at a CAMPFIRE to listen for cabin location - Coastal..."
