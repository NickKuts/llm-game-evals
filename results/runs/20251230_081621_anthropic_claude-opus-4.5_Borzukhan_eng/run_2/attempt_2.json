At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

I need to be more careful this time.\n\nThe key difference now is my approach to Borzukhan. Rather than attempting a shot through glass with a nearly-depleted stunner, I should either use the laser gun or force entry through the door.

Shoot with laser gun (10 charges) - Precise, reliable, I have plenty of ammo\n2. Throw a grenade (2 grenades) - Area damage, good against groups\n3. Fly away - Abandon the mission\n\nLet me think about this tactically:\n\nThe pirates are a \"group\" with laser guns shooting at my flyer. My flyer is now \"slightly scratched\" meaning they're hitting it.\n\nOption 1 (Laser gun): I have 10 charges, which is plenty. However, shooting from a moving flyer at a group of pirates might require multiple shots. This could work but might not be efficient against a group.\n\nOption 2 (Grenade): I have 2 grenades.

Carl said \"several grenades in case you run into armed guards\" - this is exactly that situation!\n\nOption 3 (Fly away): This abandons the mission and the discovered base. Not acceptable.\n\nGiven that:\n- It's a GROUP of pirates (multiple targets)\n- Grenades are specifically mentioned as being for \"armed guards\"\n- I have 2 grenades so I can afford to use one\n- My flyer is already being hit and I'm already wounded\n\nUsing a grenade against a group is the tactically sound choice. It's efficient (one grenade vs multiple shots) and this is exactly the situation grenades are meant for.\n\nHowever, I should also consider: what if I need the grenades later for the base assault or against Borzukhan?\n\nActually, let me reconsider the laser option. 10 charges is a lot. I could shoot them and conserve grenades for inside the base where I might face more critical situations.\n\nBut then again, I'm wounded and my flyer is being damaged. \n\nA grenade ends this quickly rather than prolonging the firefight while my flyer takes more hits. Plus, I can loot the pirate bodies afterward for supplies like that stunner I found before. I'll still have one grenade and all my laser charges for whatever's inside the base. The grenade is the right move."

I've entered the cave but a LARGE group of Pelengs is running toward me, alerted by the earlier grenade explosion.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n1. **Shoot back from the laser gun** - I have 10 charges. But it's a \"large group\" of Pelengs running at me. In a narrow corridor, I might be overwhelmed. Being wounded already, a prolonged firefight could be fatal.\n\n2. **Run out of the cave and escape in your flyer** - This is a retreat option. I'd escape, but I haven't completed the mission. However, I'd survive to try again. But my flyer is \"slightly scratched\" and I'm wounded - how long can I keep retreating?\n\n3. **Run out of the cave and hide behind a rock** - This seems like a tactical positioning move. If I hide, maybe the guards will run past me or I can ambush them? But hiding while a large group is actively pursuing me seems risky.\n\n4. **Throw a grenade into the crowd** - I have 1 grenade left. A large group in a corridor... a grenade could be devastating in confined spaces. But then I'd have no grenades left for later (like destroying the base or facing Borzukhan). Wait - I have the EXPLOSIVE DEVICE for destroying the base, so grenades aren't needed for that objective.\n\nLet me think more carefully:\n\nThe corridor is a confined space. A large group of Pelengs running toward me in a confined space is actually an ideal grenade scenario:\n- Enemies clustered together\n- Confined space amplifies explosive effect\n- No friendly fire risk\n- Quick resolution vs. prolonged corridor firefight\n\nUsing the laser (option 1) means:\n- Multiple shots needed for a \"large group\"\n- In a corridor, they're charging me - I might get overrun before taking them all down\n- I'm wounded, so extended combat is dangerous\n\nRunning to the flyer (option 2):\n\n\n- Means abandoning my progress and having to restart the approach\n- The guards will be even more alert next time\n\nHiding behind a rock (option 3):\n- If they're running toward me, they saw me - hiding might not work\n- Could be a trap option\n\nThrowing the grenade (option 4):\n- Perfect scenario: large group in a corridor (confined space = maximum damage)\n- Quick resolution\n- Preserves my laser ammo (10 charges) for later\n- I still have the explosive device for the base objective\n\nThe grenade is the tactical choice here. The corridor creates an ideal scenario for maximum effect, and I can still rely on my laser and the explosive device for what comes next.\n\nI considered hiding behind a rock to ambush them as they emerge, but that's wishful thinking\u2014a large group would spread out searching, and I'm wounded. The grenade in a confined space is the most reliable option.\n\nLooking back at what went wrong before, the issue was relying on depleted weapons. My laser has 10 charges and the grenade is intact, so both are viable. But grenades excel at area damage in tight corridors where a large group clusters together, while the laser forces me to engage targets individually. The grenade is the tactical choice here."

  "failure_reflection": "## Reflection on Failed Quest\n\n**Key Strategic Mistakes:**\n\n1. **Wasted both grenades too early** - Used first grenade on outside guards, which ALERTED the base. Then used my last grenade on the alerted group. Should have conserved grenades for critical moments deeper inside the base or for the final objective.\n\n2. **Poor exploration order** - Went to forest first, got seriously wounded for no benefit. This weakened me throughout the entire quest.\n\n3. **Ignored stealth option** - When the large group charged, \"hide behind a rock\" (option 3) might have let them pass. Instead, I chose combat again while wounded with my last grenade.\n\n**What to do differently:**\n\n- Go to MOUNTAINS directly - it's the main objective location\n- Use LASER GUN for initial combat (10 charges is plenty)\n- SAVE GRENADES for emergencies or final objectives\n- Consider STEALTH options when outnumbered, especially when wounded\n- Avoid forest early - it wounds you without benefit\n\n**Key Information Discovered:**\n\n- Mountains (North) = base entrance (cave)\n- Coast grotto = dead end (wall)\n- Forest = dangerous, causes serious wounds\n- Camp medical post provides partial healing (once?)\n- Grenade explosions alert additional guards inside the base"
