At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself.

This smoke trace in the swamp to the SOUTH wasn't on his list of suspected locations!\n\nA thin trace of smoke in the middle of a swamp could indicate:\n- A hidden base (someone is there, cooking/heating/generating power)\n- Borzukhan's actual secret base (hidden where they didn't expect)\n- A camp or settlement\n- Some other activity\n\nThe fact that this is a NEW piece of information I discovered through reconnaissance, and wasn't in Carl's intel, makes it very suspicious. A secret base would likely NOT be in the obvious suspected locations, but somewhere unexpected - like a swamp!\n\nThis seems like a classic quest twist - the real location is somewhere the quest-giver didn't expect, and you have to discover it through your own investigation.\n\nI should definitely investigate the smoke. This is likely the actual base location, hidden in the swamp where the Earth agents didn't think to look.\n\nOption 2: \"Fly to the smoke trace\" seems like the right choice here. It's new information that I discovered, and it could lead to the real base."

PRIMARY MISSION: Find and destroy Borzukhan's BASE\n2. SECONDARY: Capture Borzukhan alive (bonus 1000 cr)\n3. DON'T let Borzukhan escape\n\nI now know Borzukhan is ALONE in a cabin in the western woods. This is perfect - I can go capture him by himself without having to fight through the entire base!\n\nBut what about the human prisoner? If I leave, he'll be taken to the base. That seems wrong morally, and he might be an important ally or have useful information.\n\nHowever, if I attack 5 pirates:\n\n\n- I risk getting hurt or killed\n- I might waste resources I need later\n- Combat could go wrong\n\nA grenade won't work since the prisoner is right beside them. The laser option seems most viable - I can target individual pirates without hitting him, and 10 charges against 5 targets is manageable odds. But I need to weigh whether engaging in combat is worth it when I already have the location of Borzukhan alone in the woods.\n\nIf I slip away instead, the prisoner reaches their destination while I move independently. That gives me a chance to find Borzukhan in his cabin to the west, then locate and destroy the base separately. The cabin and the base seem to be different places - one's where Borzukhan stays, the other is where they're transporting the prisoner. I need to handle both objectives: capture or kill Borzukhan, and destroy the base. Following them might not be the most efficient path.\n\nI'm weighing whether to engage the pirates directly. Attacking them means combat risk but I'd rescue the prisoner and potentially get information about the base location. With 10 laser charges against 5 pirates, the odds seem manageable. Alternatively, I could bypass them entirely and move straight to Borzukhan's cabin while he's isolated, avoiding any confrontation. The prisoner's fate troubles me though - they might know something crucial about where the base actually is.\n\nLooking at what I can actually do here, my real options are limited: I can leave, use a grenade (which would kill the prisoner), or open fire. Given those constraints, shooting seems like the right call. It gives me a chance to save the prisoner, eliminate potential threats, and possibly gain intelligence - all while having decent combat odds. Actually wait - I should reconsider flying away. If I go after Borzukhan alone while he's isolated in his cabin, then circle back to destroy the base, that could be more efficient. The prisoner situation troubles me, but I might be able to rescue people later from the base itself. Having Borzukhan alone is a genuine tactical advantage I shouldn't waste.\n\nBut abandoning someone to the pirates feels fundamentally wrong. I'm going to engage them instead. With 10 laser charges against 5 targets, the odds favor me, and I'd rescue the captive while neutralizing pirates who could otherwise alert the base. Plus I might gain an informant."

Search the Peleng bodies - might find useful items, money, or clues\n2. Examine the man - the stunned human prisoner might wake up or have useful information\n\nBoth options seem valuable. Let me think about which to prioritize:\n\nThe human was stunned and might need help. He could also have important information about:\n- The base location\n- What he was doing when captured\n- Security information\n- Who he is (Earth agent? Civilian?)\n\nThe Peleng bodies might have:\n- Money/valuables\n- Weapons/ammo\n- Keys or access codes\n- Information/documents\n\nIn these text quests, often you can do both actions (sequentially), so the order might matter or might not.\n\nI think examining the man first is important because:\n1. He might need medical attention\n2. He's a living source of information\n3. He might be able to help me\n4. He might know about the base (which is my primary objective to DESTROY)\n\nBut searching the bodies could also yield important items like keycards, codes, or weapons.\n\nActually, since both options are available, I'll probably get to do both. Let me start with the human since he's a living person who was a prisoner - he takes priority over dead bodies.\n\nI'll choose option 2 - Examine the man."

Capture Borzukhan at his cabin (alone = easy capture)\n2. Then find and destroy the actual base\n\nThe forest (option 2) is the best choice because:\n- I know Borzukhan is there ALONE - perfect for capture\n- I have a stunner now (perfect for taking him alive!)\n\n\n- Once I have him, I can extract information about the base's location or find keys he's carrying\n- If I strike at the base first, he could slip away while I'm dealing with explosives and defenses, which violates Carl's explicit warning about letting him escape\n\nThe core tension is that the base destruction is the main objective, but Borzukhan's capture matters too\u2014and he's currently isolated at his cabin while potentially being elsewhere during a base assault.\n\nGoing to the cabin first gives me a clear advantage: I can neutralize him when he's alone and vulnerable, then use whatever intelligence or access items he has to tackle the base afterward. The stunner I picked up is ideal for taking him alive without alerting anyone. The forest route southwest seems like the right move."

Not optimal when I have a better option.\n\n3. **Shoot stunner through window** - PERFECT CHOICE:\n   - Non-lethal = captures him ALIVE\n   - He's unaware and stationary = easy hit\n   - Guarantees the 1000 cr bonus\n   - This is exactly why I acquired the stunner from the pirates!\n   - Zero risk - he can't fight back or escape\n\n4. **Step away from window** - Risky repositioning that could alert him or lose the opportunity. I already have the ideal shot.\n\n**Mission Logic:** I specifically came here because Borzukhan was ALONE. I specifically picked up the STUNNER for non-lethal capture. Everything has led to this moment. He's sitting unaware in front of me - this is the cleanest possible capture scenario.\n\nTime to stun him and claim my bonus!\n\nACTION: 3",

Let me analyze my options:\n\n1. **Move away and go back to flyer** - Why would I leave now? I'm at my objective with the perfect opportunity. This makes no sense.\n\n2. **Shoot Borzukhan from the laser gun** - This would KILL him. I can capture him alive for a 1000 cr bonus. Killing him works for the mission but loses the bonus. Not optimal.\n\n3. **Shoot the stunner through the window** - This is PERFECT!\n   - He's unaware of me\n   - I have a clear shot through the window\n   - The stunner will incapacitate him non-lethally\n   - I capture him ALIVE = 1000 cr bonus!\n   - No risk of him escaping or fighting back\n\n4. **Carefully step away from the window** - Why? To reposition? But I already have the perfect shot. This seems like it would just risk losing the opportunity.\n\nOption 3 is clearly the best choice:\n- I have the stunner specifically for this moment\n- He's unaware and stationary (sitting in armchair)\n- Clear line of sight through window\n- Non-lethal capture = maximum reward\n- Mission success for the Borzukhan objective\n\nThis is exactly the scenario I prepared for by getting a stunner and finding him alone. Time to execute!"

  "failure_reflection": "## Reflection on Failed Quest ### Key Strategic Mistakes: 1. **Shooting through glass with a nearly-depleted stunner** - The stunner was explicitly described as \"almost discharged\" with only \"one or two shots\" left. Firing through a glass window with an unreliable weapon was a critical error. Glass likely interfered with the shot or the stunner failed. 2. **Over-prioritizing the capture bonus** - I focused too much on the 1000 cr bonus for capturing Borzukhan alive instead of ensuring mission success. Should have used the reliable laser gun or chosen a different approach. 3. **Not choosing the direct approach** - Option 5 (kick door in with gun ready) might have been better. He was unaware, and I had 8 laser charges vs 1 target. A guaranteed kill beats a risky capture attempt. ### What to Do Differently: - **Don't rely on nearly-depleted weapons for critical moments** - **When target is unaware and alone, prioritize reliability over bonuses** - **Consider that shooting through windows may not work** ### Key Information Discovered: - Borzukhan's cabin: Western woods (orientation points from pirates) - Base location: Mountains (North) - Secret passage: Coast (East) - Rescue merchant for intel + search pirate bodies for supplies (stunner,..."
