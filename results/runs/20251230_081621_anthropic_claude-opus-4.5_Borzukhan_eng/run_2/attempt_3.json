At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

If this is Borzukhan, I should try to capture him alive for the 1000 cr bonus. However, from previous attempt notes:\n   - \"Don't rely on nearly-depleted weapons for critical moments\"\n   - The attempt to \"concuss\" (melee attack) could fail if he gets his weapon first\n   - Previous success with concussing was against sleeping/unsuspecting guards\n\n2. **Shoot the Peleng** - Reliable kill with laser gun. If this is Borzukhan, I lose the capture bonus but complete the mission. If it's just a technician, it clears the room for planting explosives.\n   - Uses 1 charge (down to 4)\n   - Reliable - laser gun works\n   - Carl said \"if that proves impossible you can kill him\"\n\n3. **Leave** - Abandons both the reactor (weak point!) and potential target. Bad choice.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- He is REACHING FOR HIS WEAPON - this is time-sensitive\n- I am WOUNDED - taking damage could be fatal\n- The reactor is RIGHT HERE - this is where I need to plant explosives\n- If this is Borzukhan, capture is preferred but killing is acceptable\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Concuss attempt: If I try melee and he gets his weapon, he could shoot me. I'm already wounded. HIGH RISK.\n\n\n- Shooting him: Reliable and uses minimal ammo, though I'd forfeit the capture bonus if this is Borzukhan. MEDIUM RISK.\n- Leaving: Abandons both the reactor and the target entirely. Mission failure.\n\nMy past mistakes teach me something important here: I wasted time trying to use an unreliable stunner when I had a dependable laser gun available. The real lesson isn't about chasing bonuses\u2014it's about using the right tool when speed matters. I have the laser now, and he's already reaching for his weapon. I need to act decisively.\n\nBut wait\u2014option 1 is actually a melee concuss attempt, not a ranged shot. That's a race to subdue him before he draws. If he's Borzukhan and I succeed, I get both the capture and the bonus. If I fail while wounded, he could kill me. The shooting option eliminates that risk entirely.\n\nThe concuss approach worked twice before, but those were different scenarios\u2014I had surprise on my side. Here, he's already moving toward his weapon. The conditions aren't the same.\n\nI should shoot. I'm wounded, he's alert and armed, and I need a reliable outcome. Carl made it clear that killing Borzukhan is acceptable if capture isn't feasible, and this combat situation while I'm injured qualifies as infeasible.\n\nThe laser gun neutralizes the immediate threat and lets me proceed to the reactor\u2014whether this Peleng is a technician or Borzukhan, shooting accomplishes both my objectives with minimal resource cost."

The description says \"main reactor room of Borzukhan's base\" and \"the killed Peleng is lying at your feet.\"\n\n**Key question:** Was that Peleng Borzukhan?\n\nThe text doesn't explicitly confirm or deny this. It just says \"the killed Peleng.\" However, I searched the body and the game didn't give me any specific information about identity (no \"this is/isn't Borzukhan\" confirmation).\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm at the power reactor - the structural weak point\n- I have the explosive device\n- The Peleng is dead (identity uncertain)\n- I have 6 laser charges and 3 grenades\n\n**Options:**\n1. Go back to the crossing - This would let me explore more (the door with voices is still unexplored)\n2. Set the explosive and leave - Complete the destroy base objective\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n\nIf I set explosive and leave:\n- If the Peleng was Borzukhan: Mission complete! Base destroyed, Borzukhan killed.\n- If the Peleng wasn't Borzukhan: Base destroyed but Borzukhan escapes = partial failure?\n\nIf I go back to crossing:\n- Can check the door with voices (might find Borzukhan if he's not dead)\n- But risk more combat while wounded\n- Might run into more guards\n\n**Critical thinking:**\n\nThe description says \"main reactor room of Borzukhan's base\" - this confirms I'm in the right place for the explosion. But it doesn't confirm the Peleng's identity.\n\nHowever, from a game design perspective:\n- The Peleng was at a computer in the main reactor room\n- This is a key location (power center of the base)\n- A random technician wouldn't typically be the only person in such a crucial room\n\n\n- The game might be implying this is Borzukhan without explicitly stating it\n\nBut there's also the door with voices at the crossing that I never explored. That room had talking and laughing - could be guards, could be Borzukhan with subordinates. The safest approach is to backtrack and investigate that door first. If Borzukhan is there, I'll know for certain. If not, I can return here and detonate the explosive with confidence.\n\nActually, wait. My objectives are to destroy the base and eliminate Borzukhan. If I set the explosive and escape, the reactor detonation will destroy the entire facility and kill anyone inside\u2014including Borzukhan if he's still here. That accomplishes both goals at once. The explosion handles everything, so I don't need to confirm his location beforehand. I just need to make sure I leave before it goes off."
