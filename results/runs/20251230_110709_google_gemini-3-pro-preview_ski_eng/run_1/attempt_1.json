I need to weigh them carefully.\n\n\n**Evaluating Trade-Offs**\n\nI've been examining the daily financial report.

It is clear that the beginner track bottleneck is the top priority for tomorrow's planning. I'm projecting the need for a new track, either for beginners or possibly an average track. The costs are 30,000 and 45,000 credits, respectively.\n\n\n**Gathering Data Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on advertising strategies. Talking to the Advertising Manager is crucial to understand ad costs and effectiveness. This is key to deciding which track type to build. Building another beginner track might be the safest bet, but I need to figure out how to attract pro skiers for potentially higher profits. Then, I'll consult the Deputy and then it's time to end the day.\n\n\n**Seeking Advertising Insights**\n\nI'm heading to the Advertising Manager now. The beginner track is maxed out, so new ads may be useless, but I need to understand ad costs and if I can target pro skiers specifically. It's key to my expansion plan. After that, I will talk to the Deputy. Then, time to end the day.\n\n\n"

My primary objective is to amass a fortune of 1,000,000 credits. Right now, I'm sitting on 100,000 credits. The clock has struck a halt on construction for today. I'm focusing on the next immediate actions.\n\n\n**Planning Expansion Strategies**\n\nI've been meticulously analyzing the current bottlenecks. The beginner tracks are at full capacity, clearly hindering growth. I need to prioritize their expansion. Simultaneously, the accountant's projections and the advertising manager's insights are crucial for future decisions. I must determine if the additional popularity from advertising is worth the cost, weighing it against facility upgrades.\n\n\n**Assessing Ad Spending**\n\nMy analysis has led me to a crucial point. Based on current data, I must avoid advertising *today* to avoid disappointment among potential visitors tomorrow. This means I'll forego popularity growth today, focusing instead on infrastructure expansion. The goal is to invest in tracks and lifts to accommodate the future influx, with careful financial planning.\n\n\n**Evaluating Advertising Impact**\n\nI've re-examined the ad manager's reports. It seems new visitors are attracted *tomorrow* based on *today's* popularity. Considering the track bottleneck, advertising now risks disappointment. However, the popularity decay is significant. I'm weighing the costs of minimal advertising against the benefits of preventing popularity loss, all while planning for expansion. The goal is a delicate balance.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ad Strategies**\n\nI am now reviewing the specifics of advertising.  It seems that I will not get immediate results, so I do not need to worry. The priority remains expansion, with advertising taking a secondary role. I need to balance the need to stem popularity decay with the track bottlenecks. Spending 10k is best. I will advertise to preserve my current status.\n\n\n**Revising Advertising Priorities**\n\nI've re-evaluated my advertising approach. Spending 10,000 credits seems best. My priority is to keep popularity steady to attract visitors. This lets me then build the necessary upgrades, creating more capacity, which I can use after the next turn to start spending aggressively on advertising.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the intricacies of the advertising dilemma. My priority is capacity building, specifically tracks, to avoid disappointed visitors. I've re-calculated: spending 10k on ads is optimal, as it will allow for track and lift expansion. This allows for both popularity stabilization and expansion on the following day.\n\n\n**Evaluating Long-Term Strategy**\n\nI've re-examined the numbers. Spending 10k for ads seems best. This will keep my popularity roughly stable. My priority tomorrow is building the tracks. I've re-calculated: I can build a new beginner track to solve the bottleneck issue. This balanced approach sets the stage for future growth and maximizes my resources.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ad Budget**\n\nThe current plan is to spend 20k on ads to stabilize popularity. This maintains enough funds for track and lift construction tomorrow, as well. Building new tracks is essential, but preventing the natural decay is critical for long-term growth.\n\n\n**Choosing the Ad Budget**\n\nI'm set on advertising for 20k, as it balances popularity decay with future track upgrades. I'll maintain a stable 50% popularity, then build the necessary beginner track. The goal is to maximize the cash flow tomorrow and beyond.\n\n\n**Deciding on Ad Budget**\n\nI've re-examined the numbers. Spending 20k for ads seems best. This will keep my popularity roughly stable. My priority is to build tracks tomorrow. I'll spend on ads to stabilize popularity and then build the tracks.\n\n\n**Evaluating Immediate Spending**\n\nI've made my decision. I will spend 20k on ads to stabilize my popularity, preventing the natural decay. This budget allows for a new beginner track tomorrow, avoiding capacity issues while maintaining visitor numbers.\n\n\n**Choosing Advertisements Wisely**\n\nAfter carefully assessing the advertising options and the potential consequences, I've decided to spend 20,000 credits on advertisements. This choice balances the need to mitigate the decline in popularity with the critical goal of capacity building tomorrow.\n\n\n**Analyzing Optimal Ad Spend**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the optimal advertising amount. The ideal scenario involves spending 20,000 credits to stabilize popularity and maintain sufficient funds for infrastructure upgrades. I've calculated the financial implications, and this allocation allows me to build both a new beginner track and a chair lift, critical for future capacity.\n\n\n"

My analysis is ongoing, but I'm primarily considering how to best leverage my resources early on to maximize long-term growth.\n\n\n**Considering Build Strategy**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the starting position. My primary concern is the lack of funds to build another beginner track. I'm 1,000 credits short and can't adjust the advertising budget directly. Ending the day is my only option as things stand. I'll need a financial boost tomorrow to address the track deficit.\n\n\n**Refining Financial Projections**\n\nI've re-examined the financial outlook. After crunching the numbers, it's clear I can build a beginner track regardless of advertising spend. Lowering ads to 10k gives a larger profit, but I'm wagering that increased popularity from the higher ad spend will be more beneficial in the long run. I'm focusing on balancing short-term gains with long-term growth by using high advertising.\n\n\n**Examining Adjustments**\n\nI'm now deep-diving into the \"Talk to experts\" options. Reducing advertising looks attractive, as it would bolster profits. However, I have to balance that against the potential negative impact of dissatisfied clients, versus the possible benefit of higher popularity. I still need to make sure I build a second beginner track. I'm leaning toward reducing ad spend.\n\n\n**Evaluating The Options**\n\nThe analysis continues. It's clear I can't build today, due to insufficient funds. The crucial decision is the advertising spend for day 2. Lowering ads to 10k saves 10k, enough to build an Average track (45k). If I keep ads high, the beginner track it is. I'm focusing on the trade-off between immediate profit and future popularity.\n\n\n**Formulating the Plan**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the strategy. Lowering the advertising budget to 10k today allows me to afford the \"Average\" track build tomorrow, which is superior to the beginner track in terms of overall benefit to the resort. The math clearly supports this. The \"Talk to experts\" option is the key.\n\n\n**Assessing the Ad Strategy**\n\nI've re-evaluated my Day 2 options. My lack of funds for a second build action demands a re-think. Crucially, I've confirmed that reducing advertising spend to 10k *today* will allow me to build the more beneficial \"Average\" track *tomorrow.* This will then alleviate the beginner bottleneck and serve more pros.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course**\n\nI've decided I'm one step away from finishing today. After analyzing the situation, lowering the advertising budget is the optimal strategy. This will free up the funds needed to build the Average track and alleviate the beginner bottleneck, ensuring a more profitable tomorrow, while also creating revenue for pros.\n\n\n**Deciphering the Objectives**\n\nI'm focused on the strategic play for Day 2. The core challenge is the lack of immediate building funds. My analysis centers on the optimal use of the ad spend to secure tomorrow's build \u2013 the Average track. I must make a decision about the ad budget, to maximize future income.\n\n\n"

The immediate goal is the Average Track. I have to find a balanced approach to the ads to maximize profits and minimize the drop in popularity, because of unserved guests. Perhaps a gradual reduction, or targeted ads.

Also, I'm trying to wrap my head around the money, which is a HUGE jump!  I see a report with more details. \n\n\n**Addressing the Immediate Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the tracks now. The beginner track is over capacity, with 10 unhappy skiers. The pros are unhappy, too, as expected. The popularity drop is alarming. I must alleviate the immediate bottleneck to retain the users and avoid an even bigger catastrophe!\n\n\n**Choosing the Optimal Action**\n\nOkay, so the initial analysis reveals a dire need to alleviate the track bottlenecks. The Average Track appears to be the most efficient play. I like it. This would directly address both beginner and pro skier unhappiness. I've crunched the numbers, and the Average Track costs 45,000 cr, leaving me with 80,000.  Building *another* Average Track makes sense too, for the future!\n\n\n**Revisiting Pro Skiers' Value**\n\nI'm now recalculating everything, spurred by the recent revenue numbers. Pro skiers are far more lucrative than initially thought! It completely changes my prioritization. With 6k per pro, the average track is still a solid, short-term play. Now I must focus heavily on pro capacity *as well* as beginner capacity.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Pro Capacity**\n\nI'm now calculating based on the latest figures. The revenue data reveals that pro skiers generate significantly more income than beginners! Given the bottleneck and the potential for greater profit, I will build an Average Track to handle both groups. I am going to build one, at the moment.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Pro Growth**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the revenue data again. Pro skiers are shockingly valuable, generating three times the income of beginners! That completely changes my strategy. An *Average Track* remains a good initial play to alleviate the congestion, but I need to focus on *pro* capacity *as well*!\n\n\n"

Considering the remaining funds, an additional Beginner Track seems a prudent choice to prepare for visitor growth, especially given the low cost.

The question is: prioritize further infrastructure improvements or allocate funds to immediately boosting popularity?\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Optimal Decision**\n\nI'm now certain on the Average Track to fully address the bottlenecks.

The goal is to figure out the best early-game strategy to maximize profits and increase popularity.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Initial Moves**\n\nOkay, analyzing the first few actions. The math aligns \u2013 the track build consumed funds immediately. It seems I can make further investments today, January 3rd, since building actions appear instant. Need to weigh the options for the next action: focusing on another build, or exploring other options available. Popularity is crucial, but I also need to secure sufficient funds for future development.\n\n\n**Reassessing Strategic Priorities**\n\nI've re-examined the data and I see some pressing concerns. My popularity's precariously low, and if it continues to decay, I'm toast. My infrastructure's keeping up, but it's not enough to justify an immediate expansion. I think that reintroducing advertising is more critical than anything else at this juncture.\n\n\n**Considering Advertising Strategy**\n\nI've been calculating the optimal strategy for the next move, while reviewing my finances. It's Day 2, and after the average track build, I'm at 80,000 credits. My infrastructure is fine for the present, so I should focus on increasing popularity now. I need to advertise to reverse the decline and attract more visitors. The question now is when to spend advertising budget, and how much?\n\n\n**Planning Further Investments**\n\nI've carefully assessed my situation: 80,000 credits, a low 36% popularity, and a beginner track capacity that's maxed out. Given this, I intend to invest in another track to increase beginner capacity, and then I will immediately activate advertising to capitalize on this investment and start increasing popularity.\n\n\n**Evaluating Construction and Ads**\n\nI'm ready to move forward. After thorough examination, I'll now construct another beginner track, costing me 30,000 credits. I'll then immediately re-engage with advertising to offset the natural decay and hopefully attract more visitors. This should also increase popularity, and create more revenue.\n\n\n"

Visitor count is low, but the hotel capacity seems adequate for now. Restaurants need to be checked next. My primary focus is on a strategic move to boost the popularity and attract more visitors.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Capacity Expansion**\n\nI see the need for immediate action to avoid penalties. Beginner tracks are full. With 80,000 credits, I'm leaning toward constructing a new Beginner Track. This will alleviate the current capacity constraint and provide room for growth. A new Average Track or Pro Track is secondary but could be smart too!\n\n\n**Determining the Build Plan**\n\nRight now, I'm focusing on capacity. Beginner tracks are at 100%, a major bottleneck.  Building a new \"Track for Beginners\" is the priority, costing 30k and providing a much-needed buffer for 20 more beginners. The lift and restaurant are not an issue. After this, I need to advertise.\n\n\n**Formulating a Strategy**\n\nI've decided on the \"Track for Beginners\" build, costing 30k, addressing the immediate capacity issue for the largest visitor group. This leaves a 50k balance for future advertising and other improvements, allowing flexibility. My next goal is to address low popularity through a well-budgeted advertising campaign.\n\n\n"

My revenue looks solid, but my restaurant capacity must grow to accommodate more visitors, and thus, I must grow my popularity, meaning the focus should be on advertising.\n\n\n**Re-Evaluating Advertisement Strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing the potential risks now: If I boost popularity and add more visitors without increasing restaurant capacity, then I risk losing popularity due to unhappy guests. The optimal move would be advertising and a restaurant upgrade, but I cannot do both on the same day. Should I increase restaurant capacity by upgrading, or should I go all-in on advertisement, hoping to capitalize on the next day?\n\n\n**Evaluating Optimal Ad Spend**\n\nOkay, so the restaurants are the pinch point, not the hotels. I have 50k, and I know I make about 65k a day. If I spend the money on a restaurant upgrade instead of advertising, I will still earn 65k/day. If I advertise, I can increase my visitor count. I want to keep the restaurants full to maximize my revenue. An advertising budget of 20-30k will still leave me with enough cash to upgrade the restaurants if necessary, while also boosting popularity.\n\n\n"

Gotta strategize some quick wins to boost that balance.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the current status and have zeroed in on the restaurant's overcapacity issue. My primary task is clearly to build a new restaurant, which will cost 80,000 credits. The good news is, I can afford it with my current balance. However, this leaves me with only 17,000 credits, so I will need to quickly generate revenue. \n\n\n**Formulating the Strategy**\n\nWith the restaurant project approved and underway, I'm now crunching the numbers. After the build, I will still have a healthy cash flow, so I'll be in good shape. I'm also examining the potential for further expansion by expanding track capacity, with the pro track being the most likely area for potential bottleneck.\n\n\n**Deciding Next Course of Action**\n\nI've carefully assessed the situation. My restaurant is over capacity, and I can build a new one.  After building the restaurant, which will resolve the main issue, I will still have a healthy cash flow. I'll need to consider the pros track capacity in the near future, but for today, the priority is the restaurant. The advertising budget seems sustainable, given the projected daily income.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Reviewing Current Situation**\n\nI'm checking the game's current status: It's the 3rd day, January 3000. I have 17,000 credits, or so I think. The provided text is inconsistent. There is a discrepancy between the stated credit amount and what makes sense after my last action. I need to understand this better.\n\n\n**Investigating Inconsistencies**\n\nI'm working through the financial discrepancies. The situation text says I have 117,000 credits, but building a restaurant should have significantly reduced that. I'm reviewing the logs to understand what occurred, and if the simulation is updating the financial status immediately after an action, or at the start of the next turn. It's odd, and requires further examination.\n\n\n**Evaluating Unexpected Changes**\n\nThe situation has become clearer. I've re-examined the day's progression. It looks like the financial status updated incorrectly. The prompt's text says I have 117k credits, while logic and my last action suggest 17k. Examining the logs reveals identical visitor numbers but differing cash. This suggests either a simulation error or some obscure game mechanic. I must account for this glitch or interpret the game's intent.\n\n\n**Reconciling Contradictions**\n\nI'm wrestling with the conflicting financial information. The game text indicates 117,000 credits, yet the restaurant purchase should have left me with far less. Visitor numbers match between the conflicting prompts, ruling out a revenue spike. I must decide whether to trust the current prompt's financial data, or adjust my expectations based on the previous turn's actions.\n\n\n**Reassessing Financial Status**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the current situation. I've re-read the prompts, and the financials are even more confusing. I've built a restaurant but seem to have gained money in the process, going from 97,000 to 117,000 credits. Visitor numbers match but finances don't. I've also decided to act as though I have the indicated amount of 117,000 credits and re-evaluate my build strategy.\n\n\n**Examining the Finances Again**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the financial picture. Despite the restaurant build, the game claims I have 117,000 credits, an increase from 97,000 credits. I'm trying to decipher how this happened, and also comparing reports to find further clues for any unusual gameplay mechanics.\n\n\n**Analyzing Remaining Resources**\n\nI'm now determining what to build next. I'm focusing on the pro tracks, as they have the least remaining capacity. I want to build something quickly to increase capacity. Also, I am taking into account the available budget. If I choose an Average Track, I'll have a comfortable cash reserve. I've re-examined the numbers.\n\n\n**Revisiting Available Actions**\n\nI'm now carefully planning the next construction. Despite the financial confusion, I'm proceeding as if I have 117,000 credits. The pro tracks are nearing capacity, and the lift capacity is at 47 of 60, as is the hotel. I'll need to expand, but safety is key.\n\n\n**Deciding on Building Priorities**\n\nI've re-examined the financial data again. Despite the unclear past, I must make decisions based on what's in front of me: 117,000 credits. The pro tracks are nearing capacity, and I'll soon face a lift and hotel bottleneck. I'm choosing an Average Track for financial security and capacity expansion. The lift's capacity is better but less critical.\n\n\n**Considering Game State Dynamics**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the financial uncertainty. Even though the text shows I have 117,000 credits, I still question the logic. Having built a restaurant yesterday, and with a likely lower balance before that, a gain of 20,000 credits in a single day is an anomaly. I'm going to proceed assuming the indicated funds are accurate. I'm analyzing how to leverage these unexpected funds for maximum benefit.\n\n\n**Evaluating Day 3 Actions**\n\nI've re-examined the day's progression, and I'm puzzled. I seemingly gained money after building a restaurant, going from 97k to 117k. I'm choosing to act as though I have the indicated amount of 117,000 credits and evaluating the next build. I need to prioritize pro capacity.\n\n\n"

I'm now carefully examining the game's mechanics, to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy for the ski resort.\n\n\n**Revisiting Available Options**\n\nOkay, so I just confirmed those builds. Now, I'm thinking about the gaps in capacity, specifically for beds and lifts. The visitor count, with 13 unused beds, indicates a reasonable demand. The lifts, with the same gap, make me think it's time to re-evaluate potential investments in these.\n\n\n**Anticipating Immediate Needs**\n\nI've reviewed the current financials, and the projected income looks very good. However, with only 13 available beds and lift spaces, I anticipate potential bottlenecks. It appears, therefore, the most vital investments are in expanding both the hotel and lift capacity. I need to get started on that right away, as soon as possible.\n\n\n**Assessing Today's Actions**\n\nAlright, after today's builds, the key takeaway is that I'm at the construction limit. I'm now set up for significant growth with optimized capacity and current settings. With ads running and a good profit margin, I have made my move and will end the day.\n\n\n**Reviewing Today's Financials**\n\nI've reviewed the numbers, and it's looking promising, but with a lingering puzzle. I'm finishing the day with 72,000 credits, and expecting a healthy profit tomorrow. I also noticed a puzzling inconsistency with the cash flow during the day, which I need to remember for further analysis.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Today's Actions**\n\nI've examined the discrepancies in my finances and am still trying to understand the reported cash flow. I've concluded that it is best to simply end the day, as all available building slots have been used. I will return to the next step, as indicated by the prompt.\n\n\n**Confirming Strategic End Point**\n\nMy analysis has concluded. I have hit the build limit for today. My finances are stable, with ample profit projected for tomorrow. I also have advertising running to boost popularity. Given these conditions, the best course of action is to end the current day and look forward to building capacity again tomorrow.\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Action**\n\nI've reviewed everything, including the apparent financial discrepancies that are probably not relevant. I'm at the construction limit, advertising is running, and I anticipate further income. It's time to conclude the day, as further action is impossible and unnecessary.\n\n\n"

I have 128,000 cr, a way to go to reach the 1,000,000 cr goal. Sixty visitors total have come, most are beginners, and popularity is at 60%, showing promising growth.\n\n\n**Analyzing Infrastructure Needs**\n\nI've determined that I'm facing a capacity crisis. Both hotels and ski lifts are maxed out, and my current 60 visitors are filling every slot. With positive popularity and ongoing advertising, new visitors are likely tomorrow, causing penalties. The financial situation looks promising, with a projected daily profit, but growth is immediately and severely constrained. The crucial decision now involves immediate infrastructure expansion to avoid decline.\n\n\n**Assessing the Critical Path**\n\nI've re-examined the financial projections and capacity constraints. My crucial dilemma remains. Building a hotel or a lift, given the funds I have, leaves me precariously close to financial distress at the end of the day. A lift is cheaper, but a hotel seems the more immediate bottleneck. However, I now see the possibility of *not* building any new structures. By not building, I avoid the short-term financial squeeze, and the existing popularity gains should still allow me to increase revenue tomorrow, helping me reach 1 million cr.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Building Options**\n\nThe critical question is, do new visitors even arrive if there are no beds? If so, building the lift first is a waste. But if the hotel is full, the visitor cap is 60 and the lift is useless. I'm choosing the hotel for today, and hoping the increased visitor count pays off!\n\n\n**Finalizing Infrastructure Investment**\n\nI'm now certain the hotel is the priority. Despite the cash constraints, I'm building it today, anticipating that the increased visitor capacity will drive greater revenue tomorrow. While a lift is also needed, the hotel directly addresses the visitor count bottleneck, and the financial situation looks promising, even if tight. The lift can wait.\n\n\n**Evaluating Strategic Options**\n\nI've just finished a complete analysis of the situation. Building the hotel first seems like the correct move, due to the critical visitor cap. My remaining funds will be tight, and I'm considering delaying the lift. Cutting ads to save money is tempting, but risks a decline in popularity.\n\n\n**Considering Strategic Choices**\n\nI'm now focusing on a plan of action. Choosing \"build something\" in the next turn is clearly the best next move to increase the capacity. The hotel is very expensive, and I can't afford both the hotel and the lift right now. Cutting ads could alleviate expenses, but that could also reduce the number of visitors, and I need to grow. The primary goal is to address the bottlenecks.\n\n\n**Planning Immediate Actions**\n\nMy current situation necessitates decisive action. The obvious next step is to address the infrastructure bottlenecks, and so I've chosen to \"build something\". This is due to the constraints on both beds and lift capacity, threatening to severely limit growth. Building a hotel seems a sound move to enable further growth.\n\n\n"

Right now, I'm examining the capacity bottlenecks to identify areas needing upgrades.\n\n\n**Weighing Investment Options**\n\nMy analysis revealed a critical bottleneck: both the hotel and the lifts are at maximum capacity. I'm down to two choices: build a new hotel for 110k, which increases capacity, or build a new lift for 80k to handle more skiers. The hotel boosts visitor count to 120, while the lift increases capacity, but I can only choose one for now. I'm considering the long-term impact on revenue.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Strategic Action**\n\nThe financial analysis points to a crucial decision: the hotel. It unlocks the visitor cap, while a lift upgrade merely addresses congestion. I've calculated potential daily profits exceeding expenses, even after the hotel investment, provided the expanded capacity allows for more guests. Waiting for the lift creates a hard ceiling, while investing in the hotel *immediately* allows growth and the ability to buy a lift, in addition.\n\n\n**Revisiting Ad Spending**\n\nI'm now contemplating the advertising budget: 20k per day. With the hotel purchase, funds will be tight. I'm considering dropping ad spend to the minimum to conserve cash, since the hotel build itself may attract new visitors, and I can invest in ads later when lift capacity grows. This minimizes the risk of bankruptcy.\n\n\n**Confirming the Action**\n\nI'm now fully committed to building the hotel. My primary concern is the lift capacity issue; I must address it immediately after the hotel is completed. Given the cabin lift's superior cost-effectiveness per seat, I'll aim to build one as soon as I can. Also, reducing the advertising budget is the correct move for now, to ensure funds are available for the lift upgrade.\n\n\n"

This low income is making me rethink my strategy. I need to find a way to generate more revenue quickly, or I'll be in serious trouble.\n\n\n**Calculating Profit Projections**\n\nI've got the data, but I'm struggling to decide which ski lift to purchase, given my tight budget. A \"Ski lift with chairs\" for 80,000 credits is the cheapest but a \"Ski lift with cabins\" is only an additional 30k. My net profit is good, around 56k, but my cash on hand is low. I need to balance expansion with immediate financial constraints.\n\n\n**Considering the Immediate Future**\n\nThe income projection for today is approximately 198,000 credits, easily covering the 70,000 credits in expenses. The critical bottleneck is still the lift, but I can't build today. I'm going to keep the ad spend the same since I can cover it, and I'll revisit lift upgrades tomorrow with a hopefully larger cash balance.\n\n\n**Evaluating Day's Activities**\n\nWith only 18,000 credits, my options are limited. Building is out of the question, particularly since I've already determined my hotel investment has left me cash poor. I'll maintain the current advertising spend to maximize revenue, expecting a significant influx of funds tomorrow to address the critical ski lift bottleneck.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Current Choices**\n\nI've decided to keep the advertising spend at 20,000 credits, even though I'm cash-strapped. With 69 visitors and a clear lift bottleneck, I'm wagering on an influx of revenue to fix the issue tomorrow, when I'm estimating I'll have around 146,000 credits after expenses. Reducing ads would slow income, but the lift situation demands more cash, and a swift upgrade.\n\n\n**Concluding Day's Activities**\n\nI've reviewed my current financial situation again, cross-referencing previous reports. The key takeaway: The hotel construction happened during Day 4. My options are severely limited. I will keep ads at 20,000 credits to maximize income and hope the lift upgrade resolves the bottleneck tomorrow. I will end the day.\n\n\n**Assessing the Hotel Purchase**\n\nMy current situation hinges on the recent hotel purchase, which has left me with a paltry 18,000 credits. The ski lift bottleneck is causing issues, but my income should be about 198,000, easily covering expenses. Despite the lack of funds for a lift upgrade today, I am unwilling to cut ads. The plan: endure the congestion and aggressively build a lift tomorrow.\n\n\n"

The previous balance and income streams are clear, I'm processing the implications. I'm focusing on the numbers.\n\n\n**Addressing the Crisis**\n\nThe popularity plummet is the main issue. Currently, resources are adequate for the reduced crowd. However, I've noted a significant drop in pro-skier numbers. With advertising resuming, a rebound in visitor numbers is anticipated. The emphasis is on regaining trust and understanding the underlying causes of the popularity decline.\n\n\n**Considering Potential Actions**\n\nI'm now weighing the construction options, considering the budget of 146,000 credits. The critical issue is the lift capacity, currently at 60, and its impact on popularity. I can choose between a chair lift or a cabin lift. The cabin lift, at 110,000, seems like the most strategic move to prevent future bottlenecks.\n\n\n**Determining the Best Course**\n\nAfter reevaluating the construction choices, I'm leaning toward the cabin lift at 110k, as its capacity aligns better with the hotel's 120 capacity. I'm now running the numbers on the possible consequences of the options, including the addition of tracks. While a chair lift is cheaper, I need to resolve the underlying capacity mismatch to rebuild the trust. I'm focusing now on the post-construction cash flow.\n\n\n**Choosing the Construction**\n\nMy analysis is complete; I'm certain the cabin lift is the best long-term solution, fixing the core issue: the hotel's 120 capacity versus the lift's current 60. Though expensive, it will prevent future bottlenecks. I'm now weighing the post-construction cash flow to confirm the decision.\n\n\n**Planning the Build Phase**\n\nThe core issue has been identified: the lift bottleneck. I will start the construction menu. With 146,000 credits available, the optimal choice remains the cabin lift, at 110,000, to solve the root problem. Despite the high cost, it prevents future bottlenecks by aligning capacity better with the hotel's 120 guest capacity. The immediate goal is to address the visitor capacity limits.\n\n\n"

Next, I will be thinking of the appropriate building to choose.\n\n\n**Evaluating Infrastructure Options**\n\nI'm focused on resolving the lift bottleneck.

I have a good financial buffer to mitigate any failures in this decision.\n\n\n**Considering Lift Upgrades**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the lift capacity issue and comparing the two upgrade options. The cabins offer better value per seat and will also align well with my hotel capacity. Even though cabins cost more upfront, the economic analysis is leaning towards that option. I'm also considering the financial implications, given my current burn rate and incoming revenue.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Lift Decision**\n\nMy analysis is complete. I'm definitively choosing the ski lift with cabins. The cabins offer the best value, matching hotel capacity and fully addressing the lift bottleneck. Despite the higher upfront cost, the increased capacity will create a profit margin to grow, and my projections suggest a comfortable financial position to endure the build time.\n\n\n"

Popularity is low, and I need to attract more visitors, especially pros, to improve.\n\n\n**Deciding the Next Move**\n\nOkay, I've crunched the numbers again. Income looks solid, projected at 142k, which is great. Daily expenses, however, are a killer at 70k. That means a net profit of 72k after expenses if the current visitors stay. Building another Beginner Track for 30k is the only feasible choice, and I'll add that one.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Constraints**\n\nMy focus is narrowing in on the Beginner Track as the critical constraint. While there's capacity elsewhere, the current visitor count strains the track limits. Given the positive income projections, the most logical step seems to be constructing another Beginner Track for 30k, addressing the bottleneck and fostering further expansion. I can't build any more today.\n\n\n**Assessing Track Capacity**\n\nThe situation is clearer now. My focus is entirely on the Beginner Track bottleneck. The daily income exceeds expenses, so the immediate financial risk of construction is low. Building a Beginner Track for 30k appears to be the most advantageous, freeing up further space. The alternative would be to wait a day with low capacity, and I have to build something, which is a key tactical advantage.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the financials and concluded that building the Beginner Track is the safest and most strategic move. The positive cash flow from income, combined with the low cost of the track, minimizes financial risk. Expanding beginner capacity ensures I don't hit a bottleneck and allows for future visitor growth, which could increase income even further.\n\n\n**Evaluating Track Construction**\n\nI'm focused on the user's decision, I've re-examined the numbers and confirmed building the Beginner Track is the safest move. This alleviates the beginner track constraint. The income is reliable, and the costs are lower. I will proceed with this plan, aligning track capacity with other areas.\n\n\n**Considering the Next Steps**\n\nMy analysis continues, refining my decision on the next building. Given the constrained Beginner Track capacity and positive cash flow, the construction of a new Beginner Track appears the most advantageous move, creating a larger buffer for future visitor growth and aligning with the resort's existing infrastructure. The risk of not building the track has been examined.\n\n\n"

My funds are looking solid at 68,000 credits, but I need to keep an eye on that popularity rating. Forty-three percent feels a bit low for this stage of the game.\n\n\n**Evaluating Future Actions**\n\nI've got a bit of a financial crunch with only 68k, and it looks like I need a restaurant upgrade, which costs a whopping 80k. Building a Pro track at 60k is also tempting, but not financially feasible right now. The best option is the Average track at 45k. It would give me an edge with pro capacity and increase the resort's popularity, but the funds aren't quite there yet.\n\n\n**Contemplating Visitor Flow**\n\nThe restaurant capacity is increasingly important, with visitor numbers possibly rising to 85. Building a Pro Track would be tempting, but I must prioritize the restaurant upgrade costing 80k. I must conserve funds to meet demand.\n\n\n**Considering All Available Options**\n\nThe decision matrix is tightening: I could build the Pro track today, but the cash flow might be too tight. I am leaning toward the \"Average Track\" for better resource allocation. The restaurant upgrade is definitely going to be needed soon, and an extra 45k in cash seems like the safest bet for now.\n\n\n**Planning a Course of Action**\n\nIt's time for a definitive decision. The restaurant's capacity is the most imminent issue, and the best move, given the pro track demand and my limited cash flow, is the Average Track. Doing this grants some capacity, and also makes it possible to buy the restaurant upgrade tomorrow, after which I can finally focus on pro tracks.\n\n\n**Analyzing Track Construction**\n\nGiven the pressing need to address the restaurant capacity and the potential influx of visitors, I'm now leaning heavily toward the \"Average Track\" option. Its balanced approach to capacity expansion seems to offer the best immediate benefits. I will also assess how this option helps with popularity.\n\n\n**Making the Final Call**\n\nGiven all the recent analysis, it's clear: the Average Track it is. This choice balances the need for increased Pro capacity, addresses the potentially volatile restaurant bottleneck, and ensures sufficient funds for the critical restaurant upgrade tomorrow. I can now focus on popularity gains.\n\n\n**Justifying Track Selection**\n\nMy focus is now on the optimal track build. The Average Track is the safest bet, considering cash flow and the need for the restaurant upgrade tomorrow. While the Pro Track adds dedicated Pro space and might boost popularity, the financial risk is too high.\n\n\n"

It's clear that the hotels are underutilized, with plenty of spare capacity. Given the financial constraints and the immediate needs of the Space Rangers, I'm leaning toward prioritizing maintenance and upgrades over building additional facilities right now. I need to balance expansion with resource management.\n\n\n**Calculating Available Funds**\n\nOkay, so I've crunched the numbers again, focusing on the revenue projections and expense estimates. It looks like the conservative profit estimate of 60k is solid for today. Therefore, tomorrow, I'll have around 128k credits. Considering this, I can afford to build something. The restaurant upgrade is a critical need. The best use of available funds must be balancing the Restaurant costs with the tracks.\n\n\n**Formulating the Plan**\n\nI've carefully considered the resource constraints and the anticipated revenue stream. Purchasing the Average Track, at a cost of 45k, seems the most prudent course of action at this juncture, despite being barely able to afford the restaurant upgrade tomorrow. The Pro Track is too expensive, and the Beginner Track isn't as helpful.\n\n\n**Assessing Available Options**\n\nOkay, the analysis is complete. My 68k will need to be spent, and based on the finances, the **Average Track** is the correct choice, even though the restaurant is under-capacity. The buffer for the restaurant is getting thin. I've re-calculated the capacity and utilization of each attraction, then analyzed the available options and the budget to formulate the plan. It's time to build!\n\n\n**Refining the Decision**\n\nI've re-examined the initial analysis, and I'm solidifying my plan. While both the Average and Pro Tracks are feasible given the projected financials, the Average Track, at 45k, offers the best balance of immediate needs and future growth. It provides a more balanced approach. It increases my Pro capacity while still leaving a healthy buffer of cash on hand. Therefore, I will prioritize and execute my selection.\n\n\n"

The goal is to optimize my resources and make the best decision given the current circumstances.\n\n\n**Forecasting Future Needs**\n\nI'm projecting potential bottlenecks, with the restaurants being the most pressing concern. My analysis suggests I'll be close to capacity tomorrow, given the current visitor influx and popularity gains. I believe the existing ad spend will result in a notable visitor increase over the next few days. It is time to start considering upgrading that sector.\n\n\n**Evaluating Today's Strategy**\n\nI've reviewed the financial projections: Net profit should land between 65k and 75k today, slightly better than yesterday. My immediate plan is solid: No new construction, and the current ad spend is appropriate. I'll need to focus on acquiring a new restaurant as soon as I can, since the existing one is nearing capacity.\n\n\n**Planning the Next Move**\n\nI see a clear path forward now: ending the day is the only viable option. My immediate aim is to secure a new restaurant, as existing capacity will be an issue in a day. With positive cash flow expected, I am able to meet my goal of purchasing that sector. I'll need to focus on visitor influx as I anticipate more growth.\n\n\n**Confirming Today's Course**\n\nI've affirmed the strategy: End the day. Given the calculations, the 90k from today's profits will enable the restaurant purchase needed for tomorrow's influx of visitors. This should cover maintenance and advertisements. The forecast is positive, so I am ready to close out the day.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Considering Game State Dynamics**\n\nI'm currently focused on the Space Rangers 2 game state. Specifically, I've just reviewed the date (Jan 8, Day 7), remaining time (13 days), and visitor demographics (88 total, split between beginners and pros). I'm also ready to incorporate financial data once available. My primary goal now is to understand the impact of visitor types on decisions.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nNow, I'm examining the immediate needs, specifically focused on lift and track capacity versus anticipated visitor growth. With around 134,000 credits, the critical point seems to be the ski lifts, which could cause customer anger. Beginner tracks are also getting tight. I'm prioritizing lift expansion, costing 110k, as it directly addresses the more pressing issue.\n\n\n**Deciding Lift Construction**\n\nI'm now prioritizing lift expansion. The 22-seat buffer is the most critical issue, which aligns with immediate anger triggers and the potential for a cascading failure. Given the budget of 134,000 cr, and a 110k cost to add ski lifts, the math works out. I'm focusing on minimizing guest dissatisfaction with a high-impact solution. I am ready to implement and see how this impacts my rating.\n\n\n**Investigating Financial Anomalies**\n\nThe financial data presents some inconsistencies, as I predicted. My analysis reveals a 100k credit discrepancy between expected and reported funds after building restaurants. While restaurant construction proceeded, my funds increased, possibly due to unreported income or a game mechanic I'm unaware of. I'll need to double-check my assumptions and any provided new data.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Next Expansion**\n\nI'm now prioritizing lift expansion once more, given the urgent need and a relatively healthy bank balance of 134k. The potential for customer dissatisfaction remains high. With beginner tracks also nearing capacity, I must make a call. I will construct a new Cabin Lift as a priority. The budget works and ensures the best return.\n\n\n**Planning Track Expansion**\n\nI've carefully assessed the capacity constraints, with the lift buffer (22) and beginner track buffer (18) needing attention, although beginner tracks are less pressing. My cash balance of 134,000 cr allows me to choose. I can afford the **Cabin Lift** now and still afford more later.\n\n\n**Evaluating Lift Capacity Needs**\n\nThe game presents a clear choice: build more lifts or expand beginner tracks. I've re-examined the numbers, including available cash, visitor numbers, and potential growth. With a 22-seat lift buffer and immediate construction costs, it seems like the Cabin Lift is the most impactful, ensuring maximum return.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Strategic Investments**\n\nConsidering recent and updated game data, I have 134,000 credits to work with. My primary bottleneck, the lift capacity (110 seats, 22 buffer), is far more pressing than the beginner track (90 capacity, 18 buffer), which is less urgent. I'm focusing on the Cabin Lift, which prevents instant anger. Building the Lift seems best.\n\n\n**Reassessing Budget Discrepancies**\n\nI'm now investigating the discrepancy in my funds. The 134,000 cr reported in the *current* state is puzzling, given the restaurant construction cost. Given the previous day's income and expenses, the bank balance *should* be far less. I will rely on the provided data, however. I must plan based on that figure.\n\n\n**Reassessing Data Discrepancies**\n\nI'm now forced to reconcile inconsistent financial data, specifically a 20,000 credit surplus after building a restaurant. The reported funds are 134,000 cr, but my internal calculations show a far lower amount. I must now adjust my play, however, and work with the provided figures.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating Budget Priorities**\n\nI'm now prioritizing lift expansion once more, given the urgent need and a relatively healthy bank balance of 134k. The potential for customer dissatisfaction remains high. With beginner tracks also nearing capacity, I must make a call. The prompt data shows that I *did* construct a restaurant.\n\n\n**Addressing Imminent Capacity**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most imminent bottleneck. Despite financial data inconsistencies, I'm working with the provided 134,000 cr. Given the buffers, the lift capacity is most immediately threatened. However, to hedge against potential financial discrepancies and to optimize resource allocation, I'll focus on beginner tracks.\n\n\n**Evaluating Strategic Bottlenecks**\n\nWith the beginner track buffer tight, and after confirming available funds, I've decided to address it now. A new Cabin Lift helps a little. The balance of 134k shows there's no money problem, so I will build it with beginner track expansion and balance the lift and beginner track capacities.\n\n\n"

I'm focusing on balancing income from trading with exploration for potential quest triggers and early combat experience. Keeping a close eye on the market fluctuations in the current system is key for maximizing profits. I'm prioritizing upgrades for my ship's cargo hold and weapons, anticipating pirate encounters.\n\n\n**Addressing Critical Shortages**\n\nMy cash reserves are strong, but the infrastructure is reaching a breaking point. Ski lifts are on the verge of overcrowding. Beginner ski tracks are also nearing full capacity, and I must prevent a repeat of the Day 5 popularity crash. I need to get some upgrades built, starting now.\n\n\n**Calculating Construction Budgets**\n\nWith a healthy profit margin and a critical infrastructure bottleneck, I'm weighing options. A Cabin Lift and an Average Track would be ideal, but the financials suggest I can build multiple upgrades. Still, I need to be cautious about overspending. I'm running the numbers again to plan for this and the next few days.\n\n\n**Refining Infrastructure Strategy**\n\nWith the immediate lift crisis averted, I'm now recalculating. The beginner track is still a worry, and the pro track is rapidly becoming a concern. Building a Cabin Lift and an Average Track seems the safest solution. It leaves me with enough cash to weather unforeseen fluctuations in visitor numbers and will stabilize my growth for the next few days. The numbers show the balance is the right call here.\n\n\n**Assessing Immediate Construction**\n\nI'm now deep in the numbers, comparing impending infrastructure failures. The lifts are the most critical, since they directly impact all visitors, creating a hard cap on my total incoming customers. Tracks and hotels are both vulnerable, but secondary. I have enough cash to handle all of the upgrades, thankfully.\n\n\n**Addressing Critical Infrastructure**\n\nThe lift's capacity is critically strained, the highest priority. I'm going to start by building a Cabin Ski Lift to expand visitor capacity significantly and avoid the potential for an immediate popularity crash. The plan is to get an Average Track built, after, but the lifts are the priority.\n\n\n**Evaluating Build Menu Options**\n\nI'm deep in the decision-making process for construction. The imminent failure of the lift capacity (105/110) requires immediate attention. A Cabin Lift, the most expensive upgrade, is the priority to avoid a popularity crash. I also need to begin addressing the capacity of the beginner tracks (83/90). The financial plan is safe; I can afford the Cabin Lift and an Average Track with a very healthy budget.\n\n\n"

My next step will be to explore how to exploit this positive situation.\n\n\n**Addressing Capacity Constraints**\n\nI've zeroed in on the immediate issues. The lift capacity is critically low, and beginner tracks are also nearly full, presenting the largest short-term risk. Considering my two-per-day build limit, I plan to prioritize the chair lift to quickly alleviate that pressure.\n\n\n**Assessing Immediate Concerns**\n\nThe bottlenecks are clearly defined, and now I'm weighing the options for improvement. The Cabin Lift seems the best bet for long-term viability, given the projected growth. However, the Beginner Tracks need urgent attention too, so I'm trying to balance these competing priorities within the build limit and budget.\n\n\n**Deciding on Immediate Actions**\n\nMy analysis has narrowed the focus. The Cabin Lift is the most efficient choice, given available funds and the need for future capacity. However, a Chair Lift might be enough for a single build slot. To ensure a balance, I'm examining the next step, specifically beginner track capacity. I now recognize the hotels may cap the next day's growth at 120 guests.\n\n\n**Finalizing Construction Plans**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the cabin lift for today, acknowledging it maximizes the slot usage. This is followed by a beginner track expansion to counter visitor growth. The hotel capacity, at 120, is the immediate limiting factor, although the cabin lift will prepare for later expansion. Considering the costs and benefits, this plan provides the best outcome.\n\n\n"

This tackles the immediate problem and preserves flexibility. Building the hotel first would be unwise.

I need to make a decision in \"Space Rangers 2: Resort Management,\" but I need to consider my current resources.\n\n\n**Evaluating Resort Dynamics**\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the visitor count. Building the hotel, as I recall, lifted the visitor cap. The provided \"SITUATION\" text seems to show an immediate increase in visitors, but the game mechanics are a bit unclear. I need to figure out if that increase is *because* of building the hotel, or if it represents an update to the game state at the beginning of the next turn. I'll need to watch those numbers closely to best understand the next decision.\n\n\n**Assessing Resource Constraints**\n\nThe financial snapshot still holds, confirming 201k credits. Visitor data shows restaurant capacity at its limit, alongside tight margins on beginner and pro ski tracks. Given only one build slot and limited funds, I must prioritize. My immediate focus is to address the food situation, making a restaurant build the most critical choice. The influx of new visitors tomorrow is a factor that makes me lean towards that choice.\n\n\n**Determining Next Building Choice**\n\nGiven the severe restaurant capacity limitations, a new restaurant build feels mandatory. My current visitor count, combined with the expected increase, necessitates immediate action to avoid penalties. While pro track capacity is also strained, the food issue demands my immediate attention. I'll need to re-evaluate the tracks tomorrow.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Food Capacity**\n\nI've reviewed the current situation: the restaurant is almost at capacity, and more visitors are coming. Building a new restaurant is crucial. I've considered track upgrades, but the food shortage poses a greater immediate risk. The financials are solid, and the build cost is manageable. I'm choosing the restaurant.\n\n\n**Prioritizing a Restaurant Build**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the situation, and it's crystal clear that the restaurant capacity is the immediate concern. With the incoming visitor influx, building a new restaurant is paramount to avoid penalties, since the food capacity is the most constrained. I've only one build left. Restaurant first, tracks tomorrow!\n\n\n**Deciding Resort Construction**\n\nI'm now fully aware of the resource restrictions. Building another restaurant is critical to meet the rapidly expanding visitor numbers. While the track capacity is also straining, food shortages pose an immediate threat to the resort's stability. I've chosen the restaurant as my priority, since it is the more pressing issue.\n\n\n**Deciding on Construction Plans**\n\nAfter thoroughly reviewing the current situation, I'm facing a critical choice. My initial building choice of the hotel has exacerbated existing resource constraints. The visitor numbers are growing, but the restaurant can't handle it. While track capacity is also nearing its limits, I *must* prioritize a new restaurant build. I have determined my choice, now I must make it in game.\n\n\n"

With popularity standing at a very high 83%, I can expect a substantial influx of new visitors tomorrow (likely 15-20 people). Any number of new arrivals greater than 5 will cause the restaurants to overflow, leaving guests unable to eat and damaging my popularity significantly.\n\nWhile the ski track capacities are also becoming critical (buffers of 7 for beginners and 3 for pros), the restaurant bottleneck is the most immediate \"hard cap\" that affects all visitors regardless of skill level. Ensuring guests can eat is a primary priority over skiing capacity.

The high popularity rating of 83% indicates a thriving visitor base. There are currently 130 visitors enjoying the facilities. This offers a broad range of options for selection.\n\n\n**Evaluating Bottlenecks and Priorities**\n\nI'm focused on the most critical constraints. Restaurants are the top priority with only five seats remaining. The beginner track is tight as well. The restaurant shortage has far graver implications than the track capacity. A failure there will likely cause a drop in my popularity. Therefore, I'm leaning toward constructing a new restaurant.\n\n\n**Choosing the Optimal Construction**\n\nI've made my decision. The impending restaurant shortage poses the greatest threat. The potential popularity hit from hungry guests is more dangerous than temporary track limitations. Constructing a restaurant at 80,000 credits, leaving me with 121,000, is the correct move. It allows me to secure my revenue, and handle the track bottleneck tomorrow.\n\n\n**Confirming Restaurant as Priority**\n\nI've re-evaluated the situation. The track constraints are definitely an issue, however the limited restaurant capacity is the greater threat. A new restaurant is the necessary first step. I have made the call, and I will be building a restaurant. The track shortages will need to be resolved immediately afterward, hopefully with the revenue from the incoming visitors.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Immediate Need**\n\nI'm focused on the most critical challenge: the restaurants. The current capacity of 135 seats is dangerously close to being overwhelmed by my 130 guests, plus the predicted influx. A restaurant build is the key, and I will be building the restaurant. It addresses the core need: food.\n\n\n"

Reaching the million credit mark is definitely within reach, but I'm keeping an eye on long-term sustainability to avoid a last-minute scramble.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Capacity Issues**\n\nOkay, I've got a handle on the bottlenecks. Lifts and tracks are absolutely overflowing! That's the top priority. My calculations on lift capacity were correct, so I need to get those tracks sorted *immediately*. I have the cash to expand, but I need to decide between upgrading existing tracks or building new ones. Beginners are a bigger issue than the pros, given the visitor numbers.\n\n\n**Deciding on Investments**\n\nI'm juggling building options. I'm leaning toward getting rid of the lift bottleneck first; it's the simplest fix. Then I will address the beginner track capacity, where people are most upset. I'll need to double-check the cost again, and then I will decide between a lift upgrade or an extra track.\n\n\n**Determining the Build Order**\n\nOkay, I've confirmed my initial assessments. Tracks are the biggest source of dissatisfaction right now. I'll get more beginner tracks, then tackle the pro track overcrowding. I've re-examined the lift capacity, and I can fix it with a new cabin lift. I'm going to start by getting rid of the beginner track bottleneck. I have calculated the costs again.\n\n\n**Planning Investments**\n\nThe situation is becoming clearer. I'm going to add the cabin lift first. It will solve my lift bottleneck. Then I'm going to add another average track. That should solve a lot of the problems. It's time to build, and it will cost about 155,000 cr total.\n\n\n**Considering Prioritization of Issues**\n\nGiven the immediate need for more capacity, I've re-evaluated my options. The lift bottleneck is small (3 people), but needs to be solved before expanding more. The track issues are the primary concern. Since I have 2 slots, I will build the cabin lift first, then focus on tracks. This will allow for more visitors and address both bottlenecks.\n\n\n**Reassessing the Strategy**\n\nThe existing plan seems solid, but my recent income spike of 300k raises an interesting question. With money no longer a major constraint, I will rebuild the beginner track first and then, build a lift. This resolves the key issues.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Tracks and Lifts**\n\nAlright, after reviewing the data, the course of action is clear: tackle those track shortages first. I've decided to address the bottlenecks by adding more average tracks, and then the critical lift issue, balancing immediate needs with long-term growth. It's a bit of a juggling act.\n\n\n"

My primary objective is to reach the specified goal within the given timeframe. I'm carefully considering all available options to construct the optimal building.\n\n\n**Considering Building Priorities**\n\nI've evaluated the bottlenecks in the resort. My focus has narrowed to the urgent need for more beginner and pro track capacity. While the ski lift overflow needs addressing, the critical impact of insufficient beginner tracks dictates my immediate building choices. I'm strategizing how to best allocate my limited building slots for maximum positive impact.\n\n\n**Evaluating Strategic Options**\n\nI've been weighing the building options to maximize impact with the two available slots. The critical deficits are in beginner and pro tracks, and a lift bottleneck also exists. Building an Average Track would only partially solve the beginner shortage and fully address the pro track overflow, which seems the most prudent immediate path forward. The lift issue is secondary.\n\n\n**Devising the Optimal Construction**\n\nI've been analyzing the best construction path, given the two available slots and the most pressing deficits. Considering that the lifts have a small but present overflow, and tracks are experiencing critical overcrowding, prioritizing the most impactful builds is key. The plan to build one Average Track and one Beginner Track would solve the track issue, but would not solve the lift issue. Alternatively, the cabin lift might provide a more meaningful impact. I'm leaning towards fixing both the lift bottleneck and the track issue.\n\n\n**Planning the Construction Strategy**\n\nI'm now contemplating the optimal course of action, having comprehensively analyzed the current situation, bottlenecks, and the potential impact of various building options. I'm torn between addressing the lift bottleneck or prioritizing the track deficits. Building an Average Track alongside a Cabin Lift appears highly efficient, resolving multiple issues. However, fully solving track deficits may be the more prudent move. I will be considering the pros and cons of these options as I formulate the next step.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Optimal Strategy**\n\nI've decided on the optimal first move: building an Average Track. This will mitigate overcrowding for both beginner and pro skiers. Now I'm considering the second building, weighing the pros and cons of addressing the lift bottleneck versus the remaining track deficits. The priority is to maximize guest satisfaction and potential for profit, so I am analyzing my options for the next action.\n\n\n**Planning Subsequent Builds**\n\nI've decided to prioritize an Average Track for the first build, which addresses the most immediate track overcrowding issues. I'm now contemplating the optimal use of my second construction slot. While two Average Tracks seem efficient, I need to consider the lift bottleneck and its impact on the long-term. Fixing the lift is tempting to allow more growth, but the tracks are the bigger problem.\n\n\n**Formulating a Final Plan**\n\nI've considered various options, and I'm deciding on the initial move. The Average Track offers the most impact right now, especially for the high-paying pro skiers. Then I will address the lift bottleneck. Building two Average Tracks would solve the track issue, but a Cabin Lift is necessary for the long-term, which would allow for future growth and higher capacity.\n\n\n**Finalizing Construction Choices**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the ideal build order for today. After analyzing various scenarios, I'm leaning towards an Average Track as the initial step, given its immediate impact on the most valuable customers. Following that, I'll build a Cabin Lift to expand overall capacity and eliminate the lift bottlenecks, even though it will cause some small track deficits for beginners.\n\n\n**Evaluating Daily Actions**\n\nI've finished a detailed analysis of the current situation: It's day 10, with a million-credit goal and 519k on hand. Track overcrowding is the most pressing issue. An Average Track appears to be the most efficient solution for today, with the lift overflow a secondary concern. I will then need to decide if another average track is better, or if I should focus on the lift issue.\n\n\n**Considering the Optimal Approach**\n\nI'm now contemplating how to allocate my initial two builds, considering the most urgent needs and future growth. Given the lift overflow and the immediate track deficits, prioritizing an Average Track for maximum customer satisfaction seems to be the best immediate solution. Then I'll focus on removing the bottleneck.\n\n\n**Considering Actions and Outcomes**\n\nI'm now contemplating my next move, having evaluated the bottlenecks and the financial impact. With two builds available, my decision hinges on prioritizing either the immediate track deficits or the lift bottleneck. Building an Average Track is my first step. This will provide some relief for the pro skiers, so I can concentrate on long-term growth by fixing the lift.\n\n\n"

This feels like the right moment to decide my next action, considering the money and the date. I'm strategizing the best move now, given the limited resources.\n\n\n**Assessing the Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm focused on the constraints. With a comfortable 474,000 credits, my top priority is to expand capacity. The ski lifts and beginner tracks are clearly the most urgent issues, limiting income. I must address these bottlenecks immediately to maximize profit and ensure visitor happiness. I plan to act today!\n\n\n**Prioritizing Lift Upgrade**\n\nAlright, the data is in. The bottleneck is clear \u2013 the ski lift capacity is holding everything back. Since I can only build one more structure today, the Cabin Lift upgrade is the obvious choice. This will significantly increase capacity, addressing the primary constraint. I'm going to start on it immediately!\n\n\n**Refining My Approach**\n\nOkay, the calculation continues! I've analyzed the potential consequences of my decisions. Now, I'm leaning heavily towards prioritizing the Cabin Lift upgrade today. It's clear that the lifts are the main restriction, with the potential for substantial growth, while beginner tracks still have a deficit, that should be less damaging.\n\n\n**Deciding the Final Action**\n\nOkay, here's my definitive plan. Given the impending visitor increase, I'll build the Cabin Lift (110k). Lifts are the critical bottleneck, and this upgrade ensures I can handle the influx, aligning with hotel capacity. While the beginner tracks also have a deficit, the impact of lift queues is more significant. The Cabin Lift addresses this most pressing concern.\n\n\n**Deciding on Action**\n\nI'm in a good spot financially, with one action remaining today. The lift situation demands immediate attention, as a shortage could quickly erode popularity. While the beginner tracks are also strained, the potential damage from lift queues is greater. The best move is to build a cabin lift!\n\n\n"

However, the Beginner Track overload is also a problem, and I am weighing these against each other. The Cabin Lift offers more capacity.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Capacity Issues**\n\nI have decided on building a lift to eliminate the critical bottleneck. Both the Chair Lift and Cabin Lift would solve the primary capacity issue. Given the funds available, I've concluded the Cabin Lift (210 capacity) is the better choice, addressing the imminent lift deficit and providing headroom for expansion. I'm now verifying the impact on visitor flow.\n\n\n**Deciding on Expansion**\n\nHaving analyzed the situation, I'm focusing on the Cabin Lift to address the lift bottleneck and enable growth. Despite the beginner track issue, resolving the lift shortage is the priority, ensuring smooth visitor flow and positive popularity. The significant funds allow for an investment in the Cabin Lift's larger capacity.\n\n\n**Deciding on Next Steps**\n\nThe lift deficit is fixed, and the focus shifts. I've prioritized building the Cabin Lift, which future-proofs the transport capacity. Considering the beginner track bottleneck, I must now weigh building a Beginner Track to mitigate the minor inconvenience, versus the need to scale up other aspects of the resort, like hotel space. I must also consider the immediate and long-term consequences of these choices.\n\n\n"

Now I must drill down into the details of my resources.\n\n\n**Assessing the immediate future**\n\nI've got the data mapped out. The resource situation is strong.

No actions can be taken today, so I will have to ride it out, and the situation will become more clear tomorrow.\n\n\n**Formulating the best strategy**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The immediate problem is beginner and pro track capacity. I also predict a hotel and restaurant crunch tomorrow. Unfortunately, I'm out of construction actions for today, so I'll need to absorb the overcrowding. My large cash reserves will enable immediate fixes tomorrow. I'm leaning towards ending the day, given my limitations.\n\n\n**Confirming Course of Action**\n\nI've exhausted my construction options, as confirmed by the game's interface. My financial outlook is strong, and a small deficit on beginner tracks and near-capacity pro tracks is the only concern. Given the situation, I must end the day with the existing infrastructure. No other actions are possible.\n\n\n**Evaluating Optimal Endgame Strategy**\n\nI'm focused on the ultimate goal: reaching 1,000,000 credits. Given the severe revenue generation, the priority is to expand hotel and restaurant capacity. Track deficits need addressing, but that's a smaller concern. The massive cash flow will allow aggressive expansion, ensuring the income stream continues and the win comes quickly.\n\n\n"

My primary concern is the overcrowded tracks, which are negatively impacting visitor happiness and, thus, potential future revenue. I must invest in expanding beginner and pro tracks before the end of the day to maintain and improve visitor satisfaction and ensure continued financial success.\n\n\n**Planning Track Expansion Immediately**\n\nThe most recent analysis reveals the critical need to address track overcrowding. My current net profit is more than sufficient. Consequently, I will immediately focus on building new tracks to enhance visitor happiness and secure my financial win. I'm leaning toward an average track to address the current deficit, but may build two to be safe.\n\n\n**Considering immediate Actions**\n\nI've reevaluated the strategy, realizing the high visitor count of 179 guarantees victory tonight. However, the overcrowded tracks must be addressed immediately. An \"Average Track\" at 45,000 credits, which fixes the Pro deficit, appears to be the safest and most practical immediate solution to maintaining visitor happiness, thus ensuring the high revenue stream needed. I'm going to start with an average track and then decide if another is needed.\n\n\n**Planning the Construction Phase**\n\nI am now at Step 85 of the quest, and after careful review of the data, the focus is squarely on track construction. An Average Track is the immediate priority to alleviate the overcrowding issues, particularly on the pro tracks. The hotel expansion seems risky now, but may be required later. The strategy is now to address the current deficits and maintain a smooth financial win.\n\n\n"

I'm currently sitting at 761,000 cr, so the million-credit threshold is the immediate priority. I also need to be mindful of the game's clock and plan ahead to make sure I survive until the end of the game!\n\n\n**Considering Strategic Investments**\n\nMy current financial situation is quite strong, with over 761,000 credits, and daily income of roughly 400,000 after expenses. While crossing the million-credit threshold is imminent, I'm now wrestling with resource management. My tracks are overflowing, particularly the beginner's track, which is at a deficit. Spending 45k on a track would be the most logical choice, even if I don't need the money.\n\n\n**Deciding Track Development**\n\nI'm focused on resolving the track capacity issues before considering anything else. The average track seems to be the most efficient solution, nearly eliminating my deficit. It costs 45k, which won't impact reaching my million-credit goal. So I've determined that this is the best course of action.\n\n\n**Analyzing Available Choices**\n\nI've reviewed the track options, and the optimal solution remains to build an Average Track. It addresses the overcrowding on both the beginner and pro slopes, a smart financial decision, especially considering the imminent victory. Action 4, which is the Average Track, is what I will select now.\n\n\n**Choosing Correct Action**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the options and the underlying game mechanics. Given my strong financial position and imminent victory, I'm now honing in on selecting the specific building action. Building an Average Track is the clear optimal choice for resolving overcrowding and maintaining popularity. Action 4, which is the Average Track, is my selection.\n\n\n"
