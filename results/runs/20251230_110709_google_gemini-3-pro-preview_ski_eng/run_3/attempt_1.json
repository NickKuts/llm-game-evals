Looks like I need to increase revenue and potentially manage resources better, especially considering the hotel and restaurant capacities. The next step will require a specific choice to move forward.\n\n\n**Considering my Options**\n\nOkay, the bottleneck is clear: beginner track capacity. If popularity rises, more beginners will arrive tomorrow, but they'll be turned away. Advertising now makes sense, but the capacity issue needs addressing *tomorrow*. Building is off-limits today, so I'm thinking of how to balance immediate gains with future growth potential. I have a choice to make.\n\n\n**Formulating a Strategy**\n\nI've got the data mapped out, the constraints understood. Building is a non-starter today, so it's all about managing what I've got. Boosting popularity via advertising *now* is a risky proposition, as I'll lose potential customers due to the track limit. Keeping popularity stable, or letting it dip a bit, seems prudent while I bank cash for *tomorrow's* building phase. My plan is taking shape.\n\n\n**Finalizing a Decision**\n\nI've crunched the numbers and the conclusion is clear. Advertising now would be counterproductive, given my beginner track capacity. I'll maintain my current position, aiming to build capacity tomorrow. My focus is on maximizing profit *today* and preparing for future growth. Choosing to end the day now seems the most logical path.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Outcome**\n\nOkay, I've reviewed the numbers, capacities, and potential downsides. I'll maintain my current position for now, focusing on construction tomorrow. It's time to end the day, prioritizing financial stability and future expansion. The risk of boosting popularity before expanding is too high.\n\n\n**Evaluating Advertising**\n\nOkay, I've just navigated the advertising manager's options. A small spend might offset the popularity drop, but the immediate constraint is the track. I'll stick with zero advertising for now to save funds and avoid overcapacity, and choose to end the day with the existing settings.\n\n\n**Making the Final Move**\n\nI've carefully considered the advertising options. My tracks are at capacity, meaning any rise in popularity right now is a problem, not a bonus. Spending money to *increase* the number of visitors before I can increase track capacity is a bad idea. I'll maintain my current position and finalize the day's settings.\n\n\n**Confirming the Action**\n\nI've finally finished running the numbers, and the core issue is clear. Since the beginner tracks are maxed out, advertising is a liability. It'll bring in disappointed customers. My focus now is to save resources. Ending the day is the logical move, so I should choose option seven.\n\n\n"

Cash flow is crucial, and it looks like we're starting with a decent amount, though I need to keep a close eye on expenses. The time crunch is real, so I am going to have to make quick, well-informed decisions. I need to figure out the best use of our capital, immediately.\n\n\n**2. Prioritizing Infrastructure**\n\nI'm focused on the infrastructure bottlenecks. The existing tracks are insufficient, specifically the beginner slopes are already exceeding capacity and I am losing out on visitor satisfaction. The chair lift is also close to capacity. I need to address these issues immediately to maintain, if not improve, the resort's popularity.\n\n\n**3. Strategizing the Builds**\n\nI'm juggling the construction options. Building a Pro Track offers immediate gains, attracting higher-paying guests. Alternatively, a Beginner Track addresses a core problem, increasing overall guest satisfaction. I have to balance the potential immediate income gain against the long-term potential for expansion.\n\n\n**4. Analyzing the Optimal Build**\n\nI've re-evaluated the construction options, considering the limited budget. Building a Pro Track offers a quick financial return, but neglects the beginner bottleneck. An Average Track solves both immediate problems efficiently, while also saving capital. Building both tracks is more expensive, but may also increase popularity, although I then risk running out of cash. I must prioritize maximizing capacity and popularity without overspending.\n\n\n**5. Refining the Strategy**\n\nI'm focused on the Average Track option. It solves the track bottlenecks, and the financials look solid. The analysis shows a significant profit increase, and I can still afford a new lift tomorrow if needed. The Average Track also allows for growth of both types of skiers, keeping all guests satisfied. This balanced approach is the most efficient use of resources.\n\n\n**6. Finalizing the Build Decision**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The Average Track solves the immediate track bottlenecks, allowing me to cater to both beginners and pros. It optimizes income generation, and also grants enough capital to expand elsewhere tomorrow. I'll construct the Average Track, and keep an eye on the lift capacity.\n\n\n**7. Finalize the Strategy**\n\nI've carefully considered the optimal course of action. The Average Track is clearly the most efficient and financially sound solution for Day 2. It resolves the immediate bottleneck for both beginners and pros, while leaving sufficient funds to address potential future lift capacity issues. I will proceed with constructing the Average Track.\n\n\n**8. Confirming the Strategy**\n\nThe situation is clear: I must begin construction to resolve the current track capacity bottlenecks. Given my limited resources, the Average Track offers the optimal solution. It addresses the immediate needs of both beginner and pro skiers. I will choose the \"Build something\" option to start the construction process.\n\n\n**9. Confirming the Course of Action**\n\nI've carefully considered the Day 2 options. My priority is addressing the track bottlenecks, as both beginner and pro skiers are currently unsatisfied. The \"Build something\" option allows me to begin construction immediately. The Average Track is the most efficient and financially sound solution, allowing for immediate income generation.\n\n\n"

Visitor numbers, though low, are within manageable hotel capacity. I must now evaluate resource allocation to maximize potential across the remaining days, specifically focusing on visitor engagement and possible upscaling.\n\n\n**Examining the Data**\n\nI'm digging deeper into the financial figures, confirming initial impressions. The 85,000 cr balance is reassuring. However, I'm focusing on the ski lift and beginner track capacities, which are nearing their limits. It looks like the maintenance expense might have improved the track conditions, which is worth considering for the next steps. I am going to see about how to engage the pros.\n\n\n**Foreseeing Tomorrow's Issues**\n\nI've considered the growth trajectory, and I'm predicting potential lift capacity issues by tomorrow. The current financial standing allows for a chairlift, but I'll need to balance that investment against the need for other improvements, specifically, advertising, to boost visitor numbers. I'll need to prioritize.\n\n\n**Contemplating Tomorrow's Actions**\n\nI've projected the financial implications of building a chairlift today, recognizing the capacity issue is pressing. With only 5,000cr remaining after construction, I'm wary of the maintenance costs and prefer waiting until tomorrow to increase cash flow, which will leave me enough to build the lift. Avoiding a potentially tight cash flow is the priority, even if it means some lift overcapacity.\n\n\n**Assessing Tomorrow's Choices**\n\nMy analysis indicates that the ski lift capacity presents the most pressing constraint for the next day. While I could build a chair lift today, the remaining funds would be too low for comfort. Considering all factors, I think it's better to postpone lift construction to allow for a cash buffer, and focus on advertising.\n\n\n**Evaluating Risk Tolerance**\n\nI've decided against building a chairlift today, as the 5,000 cr remaining would be far too risky, even with projected profits. My analysis now focuses on the optimal advertising strategy, recognizing the trade-off between growth and resource management for the upcoming day. I am going to have to decide when and how to advertise to grow my business.\n\n\n**Planning for the Turn**\n\nI'm now fully focused on tomorrow's operations. My current priority is to hold off on constructing the chairlift today. I anticipate a modest increase in visitors and the risks of spending the last of my funds are too great. I will keep advertising to zero.\n\n\n**Planning the Day's End**\n\nMy analysis indicates avoiding the chairlift construction today is the safest option. The potential cash flow issues are too risky, so I will end the day with zero advertising, saving funds to comfortably build tomorrow.\n\n\n"

My coffers hold 128,000, but I see a troubling drop in popularity at 35%. I must address this soon. I have 29 visitors, and only 2 are beginners.\n\n\n**Identifying Key Priorities**\n\nOkay, the ski lift is a major bottleneck with only one open seat. Popularity is tanking, so I need to invest in that. My income seems steady, around 43k per day, and I have a decent cash reserve. I have some time, but action is required to avoid disaster.\n\n\n**Planning Immediate Investment**\n\nI've decided. Building the chair lift is the priority, costing 80k and leaving me with 48k. Popularity is the next concern; I will need to spend on advertising soon. The analysis underscores the urgency of addressing the lift bottleneck. Failure to do so could trigger a cascade of negative effects.\n\n\n**Confirming the Build Decision**\n\nI've reviewed the options again. The chair lift build is the clear winner; with the lift exceeding capacity and popularity dropping, it's essential for preventing immediate collapse. I'm allocating 80k to build, leaving me with 48k. I also recognize that advertising needs to begin soon. It looks like building will consume the action for today.\n\n\n**Formulating a Building Strategy**\n\nAlright, the lift situation is dire, so the chair lift build is mandatory. It's the only sensible option now; I will choose that in the menu. This'll leave me with a much leaner cash reserve, but it solves the primary problem. Then I will need to consider an advertising plan, as the lift will provide more capacity.\n\n\n"

The Chair Lift is built, and I am strategizing how best to utilize the remaining days and resources. My focus is on maximizing efficiency to meet the game's objectives.\n\n\n**Evaluating Conflicting Narratives**\n\nIt seems the text-based game presents information a bit strangely. I'm trying to reconcile the game's date progression with its reports, which are inconsistent. The Day 2 report shows my actions complete, but the text's flow suggests a different timeline. It seems I can take multiple actions on the same day. Understanding this is key to efficient resource management.\n\n\n**Interpreting Game Mechanics**\n\nThe game's pace is starting to become clear. Despite the reports, I can clearly take multiple actions per day. Also, the building projects seem to complete instantly. Furthermore, the popularity and capacity data are now updated in sync with my actions. Now, I have a clearer picture of my financial and visitor status.\n\n\n**Refining Resource Allocation**\n\nThe income calculation clarifies my approach. It's Day 2, and with a 70k income and a 25k maintenance cost, I should have plenty to spend on advertising. I can safely allocate 20,000 cr. to ads today, pushing popularity and, in turn, future income. I'll need to check the exact timing of income and expenses.\n\n\n**Reflecting On Financial Risks**\n\nGiven my current financial state, I'm planning to allocate 10,000 credits to advertising today, pushing popularity to boost visitor numbers. I've calculated the expenses, including the 25,000 credit maintenance and the potential revenue based on the current number of visitors and prices. I need to be cautious about overspending and triggering a financial disaster.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nThe game's confusing timeline is clarified, allowing me to take multiple actions per day. My income is calculated, so I have enough capital. I have allocated the budget. I have determined that it is safe to spend 10k on advertising, despite the small risk. I'll interact with the advertising manager to boost my resort's popularity.\n\n\n**Reassessing Tactical Decisions**\n\nAfter reviewing all options, I've decided to proceed with the advertising campaign. Spending 10,000 credits seems the optimal choice given my budget, which will still leave 13,000 available after expenses. I will now choose \"Talk to Experts\" and configure the advertising to bolster my resort's popularity.\n\n\n"

This will influence my next decision.\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Actions**\n\nI've reviewed the infrastructure and visitor numbers.

I'm focusing on immediate solutions: increasing restaurant capacity, then building a new beginner track to accommodate all visitors.\n\n\n**Considering Immediate Priorities**\n\nThe immediate track deficit with the beginners is critical. Adding another \"Track for Beginners\" would provide 20 more beginner spots, solving the current deficit and providing for potential growth. It is a more pressing issue than restaurant capacity, even though the restaurants are nearly full. The budget is manageable; the maintenance cost increase is acceptable.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the situation, and the beginner track deficit is critical. Forty beginners versus a capacity of thirty means ten are unhappy and lowering popularity. Building another \"Track for Beginners\" seems the best solution, providing 20 more spots. The budget allows it and can be done without financial risk, although restaurant capacity is a potential secondary problem.\n\n\n**Deciding on Building Priorities**\n\nOkay, I've reviewed the numbers, the beginner numbers are still climbing, and the restaurant is on the brink. While the restaurant *could* be a problem, unhappy beginners are actively hurting my popularity score. Building a \"Track for Beginners\" seems essential, and I have the budget for it without financial strain. It's the most impactful solution for the immediate term.\n\n\n"

Currently, I'm working through the implications of our 83,000 cr. in funds, especially concerning the daily expenses of 35,000 cr. It appears the 25k track maintenance cost and 10k advertising costs are significant, and I need to see which costs can be cut, if possible.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the best use of our funds, with the critical restaurant shortage and beginner track capacity issues being foremost. The beginner track is the most pressing problem. Building a new track will cost 30,000 cr. It's a quick fix. I'm also watching visitor numbers and hotel/ski lift capacity. I think laying the track is the best immediate solution.\n\n\n**Considering All Possibilities**\n\nThe beginner track, with its 30,000 cr cost, is the only viable option given my current funds and daily expenses. While the restaurant bottleneck is a serious threat, its 80,000 cr construction cost would lead to immediate bankruptcy, a critical failure. This leaves me with a very tight budget.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Course**\n\nI've decided. The beginner track is the priority, despite the pending restaurant issue. My reasoning: the 10 unhappy beginners are impacting popularity *right now*. Building the track, at 30,000 cr, leaves me with 53,000 cr and a safe buffer against daily expenses. My plan is to endure the restaurant complaints, then collect income and build it on the next turn.\n\n\n**Determining Immediate Priorities**\n\nI'm now fully committed to building the beginner track to alleviate the current track shortage, understanding the financial implications. The costs are clear: 30,000 cr for the track, increasing daily expenses to 45,000 cr. However, this still leaves a comfortable 8,000 cr buffer, which is a key consideration. The restaurant's impending crisis is unfortunate, but less damaging, so it must be postponed.\n\n\n"

I'm considering trading routes and checking for any lucrative contracts I can fulfill to get a better start. The pressure is on!\n\n\n**Planning Expansion Strategies**\n\nI am now assessing my financial position to make informed decisions. My biggest issue is restaurant overflow, followed by the beginner tracks. Building both eats up nearly all my funds, leaving almost nothing for the next few days. It's a tight squeeze. Considering these options and looking for some revenue streams quickly!\n\n\n**Refining the Budget and Timing**\n\nAfter reviewing the mechanics of the game, I've confirmed that daily expenses are subtracted at the day's end, alongside any construction costs. I'm now acutely aware of how quickly cash reserves can dwindle. Given the restaurant and beginner track capacity issues, I am trying to estimate today's revenue. I must prioritize building one or the other, or risk losing customers.\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Outcomes**\n\nI'm deep in the financial calculations. Building a restaurant first will leave me with 32k, but daily expenses are 45k. This initially looks like a loss. However, I have to account for income. 51 beginners at 2k each, plus 3 pros at 6k each, generates 120k in revenue! So, even if I go negative at the start of the day, I'll be flush by the end. Still, the overflow situation necessitates an immediate decision. I need to make the correct calculation.\n\n\n**Assessing the Immediate Risks**\n\nMy analysis is evolving. I have overflow issues with restaurants and tracks. The immediate problem is bankruptcy risk, given my tight budget. I've re-calculated the likely end-of-day balance to determine whether building a restaurant and/or a track will lead to bankruptcy before income is added. Critical decisions ahead!\n\n\n**Deciphering the Financial Model**\n\nOkay, I've got the calculation down pat: Current Balance - Construction Cost - Expenses + Income = New Balance. Building a restaurant would leave me short on funds initially, creating bankruptcy risk, but income should cover it. It's a gamble! The best move is not yet obvious. More consideration is required before the next action is taken.\n\n\n**Revisiting Financials**\n\nI've re-examined the financial model: Current Balance - Construction Cost - Expenses + Income = New Balance. With a restaurant, I'll be short before income arrives, which creates a bankruptcy risk. I'm now recalculating the income and expenses to determine the actual end-of-day balance to decide my next move.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI've re-examined the day's financial constraints. Building a restaurant first incurs an immediate deficit. Given that income arrives after, the lack of sufficient funds creates risk. I'll need to meticulously balance construction versus potential losses, and ensure sufficient income.\n\n\n**Evaluating Solvency Thresholds**\n\nI'm now laser-focused on the bankruptcy risk. Building a restaurant would leave me critically short of funds. However, I can build a Beginner Track safely. I am now reassessing my cash flow to understand if income arrives before expenses, and the penalty for going broke.\n\n\n**Calculating and Assessing Risks**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the financial details, meticulously reviewing how expenses and income interplay. Building the restaurant presents a temporary shortfall, yet the projected income is promising. I am, however, weighing the risks, especially given the game's mechanics of deducting expenses. It's a calculated gamble at this stage.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Crucial Actions**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the restaurant build, given that the income will offset expenses despite the initial shortfall. I've crunched the numbers, and building the restaurant *should* be safe. My next step is clear. The key is to take action.\n\n\n**Analyzing Building Priorities**\n\nI've re-evaluated the financial risks and rewards, particularly the order of operations for income and expenses. The restaurant capacity issue is more pressing, but the construction cost leaves me vulnerable. After calculating the results, the risk is minimal. I'll need to prioritize the restaurant.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Calculated Risk**\n\nI've made the decision to build the restaurant, despite the potential financial strain. It's a calculated gamble, given the 9 unhappy guests and the tight budget. I hope I can overcome the short-term cash flow problems!\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\nI've weighed the risks and determined that prioritizing the restaurant build is crucial to mitigate the capacity issues. I've re-calculated the end-of-day finances and am confident in the safety of the strategy. The next step is a clear choice, so I'm moving ahead with the build option.\n\n\n"

My primary goal is to reach 1,000,000 credits. Initial resource management and strategic planning will be key.\n\n\n**Refining Financial Models**\n\nI'm digging deeper into the financial discrepancies. The initial report showed 112k before construction, which aligned with my calculations. My focus is on pinpointing why the status block showed 132k. I'm re-examining the previous step to identify any hidden transactions or misreported figures.\n\n\n**Unraveling Discrepancies**\n\nI'm puzzled. I clearly spent on a restaurant construction but the current balance increased from 112k to 132k. Maybe a glitch? I will meticulously re-check the timestamps and cash flow from steps 29-31 to identify where this unexpected influx came from, ignoring the initial report text and focusing on status updates.\n\n\n**Deciphering the Finances**\n\nI'm now completely stumped by the numbers. I'm analyzing the provided status reports and previous steps for a possible explanation. The most recent steps seem contradictory, and I am trying to determine whether the game mechanics are inconsistent, or if there's a misunderstanding on my part about the timing of financial updates. I am meticulously reviewing the data from the last few turns, looking for any clue.\n\n\n**Identifying Crucial Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm focusing on the capacity constraints. With nearly full occupancy, I must address the incoming tourist volume. The hotel and lift, running at capacity, will restrict growth soon. Building more beginner slopes seems unnecessary, pro slopes are fine. I should immediately start thinking about hotels and lifts.\n\n\n**Identifying Infrastructure Priorities**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the current bottlenecks. The hotel and lifts are approaching capacity, with the beginner slopes slightly overloaded. My focus is on addressing these critical constraints immediately to facilitate expansion, so I'll need to consider how to optimize for revenue growth. It seems the lift is slightly behind.\n\n\n**Addressing Critical Overload**\n\nI'm focused on the current, pressing constraints. The beginner track is currently overloaded, with the hotel and lifts rapidly approaching their limits. Considering my financial situation, I'll build a beginner track to address the immediate constraint, and then consider expanding my hotel capacity.\n\n\n**Assessing Current Bottlenecks**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the current situation, identifying that the beginner track is overloaded, and my hotel and lifts are nearing capacity. Given these constraints, building more beginner slopes seems to offer the most immediate benefit. I should therefore focus on the beginner track.\n\n\n**Assessing Current Strategy**\n\nThe beginner track capacity is strained. The hotel and lifts are approaching their limits. The income and expense situation remains puzzling, but I will focus on maximizing current resources. My next move: immediately address the track bottleneck. The construction menu awaits.\n\n\n**Evaluating Priorities**\n\nI'm now fully reviewing the current situation, weighing immediate needs against future growth. The beginner track overload and upcoming capacity limits on the hotel and lifts are the primary concerns. Considering my budget, I will prioritize a beginner track to immediately alleviate the current constraint.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Track Capacity**\n\nGiven the confusing financial fluctuations, I'm focusing on the concrete problem of the overloaded beginner track, which is creating a bottleneck. I'm now clear that addressing this track's capacity is the most strategic move to prevent reduced popularity.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Numbers**\n\nI'm puzzled by the inconsistent financial reports. I had 112k, built a restaurant, but still show 132k! Is it a reporting error or an unexpected bonus? Despite the confusion, the beginner track overload needs immediate attention.\n\n\n"

I need to make a crucial decision in this text adventure game and figure out the optimal next move for my build. The options are...\n\n\n**Prioritizing Build Strategy**\n\nI've reviewed the game state, specifically on Day 4, and I'm focusing on the bottlenecks. My beginner ski tracks are already over capacity, which is bad, and both hotels and ski lifts are nearly full, leading to customer loss. I have healthy funds, strong popularity, and lots of cash. I must optimize my next build, balancing capacity increases with potential ROI.\n\n\n**Choosing Next Construction**\n\nI've examined all the available building options meticulously. Considering my healthy cash reserves, I'm leaning heavily towards addressing the beginner track bottleneck. It seems the most sensible move to lay more beginner tracks immediately; this is the most cost-effective and urgent solution. I have to avoid a dip in satisfaction. Laying average tracks is also a good option, though it is slightly less efficient.\n\n\n**Choosing Build: Decision Time**\n\nThe analysis is complete. My immediate priority is addressing the beginner track overflow. The numbers are: 132k cash, 51/50 beginner track usage, 6 beds/seats remaining. Building a beginner track for 30k is the most efficient solution, costing the least, addressing the most pressing need and preserving cash. It sets me up well for future hotel builds tomorrow.\n\n\n**Deciding Build, Final Thoughts**\n\nThe analysis confirms the most efficient move is to immediately build a beginner track. This eliminates the bottleneck and is cost-effective, leaving sufficient funds to build a hotel tomorrow. After checking the math to verify my cash flow projection, I'm confident. I now just need to make the build selection and click the button to resolve.\n\n\n**Deciphering Cash Flow**\n\nOkay, there's a discrepancy in the cash flow, which is concerning. The restaurant build should have reduced my funds, yet the numbers show an increase. I'm reassessing whether the provided game state is accurate, possibly implying a lag in income application. I must determine if the \"Step 32\" data represents the *start* of the day, or a faulty calculation.\n\n\n**Verifying Financial Clarity**\n\nI'm now in a state of confusion regarding the actual cash on hand. The provided data shows an unexpected increase after a build, which clashes with prior calculations. I'm carefully reviewing all the numbers to understand if there was a typo, a lag in the simulation, or a misunderstanding about when income is applied. This is critical before making any final build decision!\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Risks**\n\nOkay, there's a serious discrepancy with the cash balance, casting doubt on the immediate action plan. My prior calculation suggests a far lower balance than reported, making any build risky. I need to know the *actual* funds to make a good choice to build. Is there really a bottleneck if a huge wave is coming? The situation is getting more tricky than initially thought, but I think I am at a bottleneck.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Current Funds**\n\nGiven the confusing cash flow, I'm now erring on the side of caution. My primary focus is preserving my reported 132k and ensuring I have maximum flexibility for tomorrow's builds. The optimal play is to do nothing today. This way, I have more funds available, and I can be confident on what the financial future is.\n\n\n**Considering Building Restrictions**\n\nI'm now contemplating my next move, specifically the timing. Given the confusing cash flow and the rule of \"two buildings per day\", I'm leaning heavily towards *not* building anything. I need to ensure my funds are accurately represented and to prepare for a likely hotel build. I need to be certain about my balance before committing!\n\n\n**Considering All Options, Again**\n\nNow, I'm carefully reviewing all the data, even the numbers. I've calculated, re-calculated, and cross-checked my cash flow assumptions, especially because of the conflicting financial data. I'm focusing on the best path to maximize my assets, minimize risk, and best manage the beginner track constraint.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Tracking the Game's Dynamics**\n\nI'm analyzing the game's state: it's Day 5 of the text quest \"Resort.\" I've got a decent 167,000 credits, but my popularity dipped to 46%. I'm currently hosting 60 visitors. I need to figure out what's causing the popularity drop and how to maximize profits within the remaining 15 days.\n\n\n**Planning Capacity Expansion**\n\nI've got it. Based on the \"Resort\" game's state, I'll prioritize immediate expansion. Building a hotel (110,000 credits) is crucial, and should be the first build. It's the only option preventing growth. Then, a Chair Lift (80,000) will keep the ski traffic flowing. I should have enough money left to maintain infrastructure after these builds.\n\n\n**Evaluating Economic Strategies**\n\nI'm now weighing the income and expenses. With 60 visitors, my daily income is approximately (56 beginners * 2k cr) + (4 pros * 4k cr), which is roughly 128,000 cr. If I build the hotel, even a chair lift may not be possible. I need to determine the ideal build order for maximum profit and to prevent visitor disappointment.\n\n\n**Refining Build-Order Prioritization**\n\nOkay, so I will build the hotel today, using 110k of my current funds. This nets me 57k remaining. Tomorrow, I'll have more income from increased occupancy. At that point, the lift is the priority. But what kind of lift? The Cabin is more expensive. \n\n\n**Prioritizing Strategic Investments**\n\nMy current analysis indicates a critical need for expansion. With a full hotel and lifts, and a dropping popularity, the immediate priority is to construct the hotel (110k). This unlocks the potential for more visitors, and thus, more income. The lack of a lift, while problematic, is a secondary concern. The lift bottleneck can be addressed tomorrow. I believe this will provide the highest return.\n\n\n**Formulating a Building Strategy**\n\nAfter analyzing the game state, it's clear that the hotel is the priority; the current population cap is holding back revenue. I'll build the hotel immediately and address the lift issue tomorrow. This approach focuses on long-term growth by maximizing the capacity for visitors.\n\n\n"

I have 14 days left and a solid 158,000 credits. The clock is ticking, and the funds are looking good so far.\n\n\n**Addressing the Critical Bottleneck**\n\nI see the key issue now. The ski lifts are the problem, causing the popularity dip. My next move is clear: acquire more lift capacity immediately. With 158,000 credits, it seems I can definitely afford a new lift, and my top priority is to alleviate this bottleneck before things get worse.\n\n\n**Considering Lift Construction Costs**\n\nOkay, here's the current thinking. I'm focusing on the ski lift options: either a chairlift (80k) or a cabin lift (110k). While the cabin lift is more expensive, its impact on capacity will be more significant. With a little less than 160k in hand, I can build it. I'm now cross-referencing this against my current daily expenditures, which will impact how much I can invest. It looks like it is safe to proceed.\n\n\n**Finalizing Construction Plans**\n\nNow, I've gone over the entire situation again, including the potential bankruptcy. Considering everything, I'm confident in going for the Cabin Lift, which provides the most immediate relief and prepares for future growth. The money should be enough, and I can build a beginner track later if needed. The advertising is still not necessary yet.\n\n\n**Final Decision Made**\n\nHaving reviewed all factors, I am now set on building the Cabin lift. Although I'll be left with less cash (48,000 credits), the increased capacity to 110 should fully address the bottleneck and is likely to boost the popularity rating again, and future income. Beginner tracks can wait. The financial calculations support this choice, and I am going ahead.\n\n\n"

Yesterday's ski lift bottleneck is the likely culprit, and I need to prioritize fixing that immediately. It seems that the bottleneck is causing a substantial problem, and I have to stop the decline in popularity.\n\n\n**Deciding Next Construction**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the lift situation now. With 158,000 credits, my core goal is to boost popularity ASAP. Option 6, the chair lift, is more budget-friendly, but it's a short-term fix. Option 7, the cabin lift, offers more capacity and should buy more time. The cabin lift makes more sense, and I have to decide quickly.\n\n\n**Deciding on Next Steps**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The user's Space Rangers resort is in a critical state due to the ski lift bottleneck. With a budget of 158,000 credits and a need for immediate improvement, I've weighed the options: the chair lift (option 6) versus the cabin lift (option 7). The cabin lift, though pricier, aligns with my hotel capacity and offers a longer-term solution. I will proceed with Option 7. It's the only option that really matters.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nThe analysis is done. The user needs a new lift, and fast. Given my low cash reserves of 48k after the lift purchase, I need to know: Am I okay to spend now, or do I need to re-evaluate? I'm assessing the impact of the cabin lift purchase on my finances, considering my projected income versus expenses. I believe the cabin lift is the best long-term option to get me to a million.\n\n\n"

My cash reserves are at 48,000, a bit behind schedule. I'll need to focus on optimizing trade routes or identifying lucrative missions to achieve my goal.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Current Challenges**\n\nI'm now contemplating the immediate impact of my low popularity, which is a major bottleneck on growth. My daily expenses are substantial, and the income projections seem promising. However, with daily expenses at 55,000 cr, popularity must improve to keep up. I am considering adjusting ad spending.\n\n\n**Evaluating Advertising Strategies**\n\nI am now focusing on advertising budget adjustments. Current expenses are high, and the initial cash reserves are dwindling. To increase visitor numbers quickly, a significant increase in ad spending is needed, despite concerns about immediate cash flow. My primary challenge involves calculating whether daily expenses are deducted before income is added in the game's mechanics.\n\n\n**Reviewing Financial Risk Assessment**\n\nMy analysis has concluded that the game mechanics use a \"net calculation\" for daily finances: (Cash + Income) - Expenses. I've confirmed that the game does *not* end if expenses exceed cash, provided income covers it. This clears the way for increased advertising spending, which is crucial given the low popularity and substantial excess capacity. I plan to discuss advertising strategy.\n\n\n**Reviewing Strategic Priorities**\n\nI'm now shifting my focus to address the urgent issue of low popularity. My existing capacity in hotels and tracks allows for significant expansion, provided I attract more visitors. The question now becomes whether to directly boost popularity through infrastructure or to accelerate the process by strategically increasing advertising spending to fill up the available capacity.\n\n\n**Planning Expansion Strategy**\n\nI've decided to aggressively increase ad spending after confirming the net calculation mechanics. Now, I will talk to the Advertising Manager, then build a beginner track to address potential capacity issues from increased visitor numbers and an instant popularity boost. With increased advertising, I should then see significant improvements to my visitor count.\n\n\n**Evaluating Turn-Based Actions**\n\nI've considered all possible actions in this turn. Increasing advertising spend is the priority; however, given the urgent need to expand visitor capacity, I must address potential future bottlenecks. I'll engage with the advertising manager, then build a beginner track to secure capacity before prioritizing ads.\n\n\n**Deciding First Actions**\n\nI'm now calculating the best first move. With 36% popularity and ample hotel space, my key goal is increasing visitor numbers fast. Therefore, I will contact the Advertising Manager and then, build a beginner track to counter possible capacity issues.\n\n\n**Deciding Advertising Action**\n\nI'm now completely focused on increasing advertising spending, which is my most crucial move. My priority is to counteract the low popularity. I've analyzed potential bottlenecks and cash flow. My next step will be to talk to the Advertising Manager.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Considering Surplus Beds**\n\nMy focus is on the excess hotel capacity in the game. I see a significant surplus of 52 beds, given the current visitor count. I'm wondering about the implications. Is this an inefficient use of resources, or does it offer strategic flexibility for future growth? I need to analyze how this surplus impacts profitability and potential expansion plans.\n\n\n**Calculating Ad Effectiveness**\n\nI've got the data on the current state of things. The huge surplus in hotels and the low popularity are screaming for attention. The plan is to pump the advertising budget up to see if it can fill the empty beds. I need to figure out the optimal amount to spend to maximize visitor count. I'm crunching the numbers to get a good idea of ad efficacy.\n\n\n**Refining the Budget Approach**\n\nI've examined the financial implications of increasing the ad spend. It's clear that even at the maximum ad budget of 50k, I'll remain profitable. The biggest risk is not financial, but whether the tracks can handle the potential influx of visitors. I'm leaning toward maximizing the advertising to capitalize on the excess hotel capacity and improve the popularity rating. I'm now fine-tuning the exact budget amount while keeping track capacity as the limiting factor.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Best Action**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the optimal play. The primary goal is to fill those empty beds and boost popularity. I can safely increase the ad budget. But, to truly maximize the profit, I'll aim to add a beginner track for the new influx of visitors. This should leave me with a comfortable profit even if the popularity spikes. The crucial step now is deciding on the optimal ad spend given the potential of building a new beginner track.\n\n\n**Optimizing the Budget and Builds**\n\nI'm focused on executing my plan. Raising the ad budget to 30,000 to improve popularity is the key. Given the game mechanics, I can build a beginner track immediately afterward, since changing ads returns me to the main menu. This will help address potential overcrowding. My cash flow is safe, allowing me to take both actions without issue.\n\n\n**Choosing the Optimal Action**\n\nI'm now fully committed to a high-impact advertising strategy. Given the game mechanics, I can build a beginner track immediately after setting my advertising budget, thanks to the menu reset.  I've chosen a 30,000 cr ad budget, which should boost popularity significantly. This will fill the many empty beds and maximize profit, even if track capacity is stretched.\n\n\n**Refining the Resort's Actions**\n\nI've examined the situation and it calls for decisive action. The primary problem is the low popularity, leaving many beds empty, and the potential for overcrowded beginner tracks. The solution is clear: boost advertising and immediately build a new beginner track to accommodate the expected influx of visitors. I'm choosing the aggressive strategy and spending 30,000 credits on ads to fill the nearly empty hotel and maximize profit.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nI'm now prioritizing actions. The strategy is to aggressively fill the 52 empty beds. I'm focusing on advertising to boost popularity. 30,000 cr is the ad budget I've chosen. Next, I'll build a beginner track to handle increased visitor numbers and optimize overall profit. The goal is to drive the biggest revenue increase!\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Actions**\n\nI'm focused on the most critical choice. Boosting ad spend to 40,000 cr is vital to fill the hotels, which is the most effective approach. I'll follow this by immediately constructing a beginner track to accommodate the expected visitor increase. The current high potential revenue outweighs the costs, providing a solid path to profits.\n\n\n**Choosing Resort Actions**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on my next play. A sharp increase in ad spending is vital to boost popularity and fill those empty beds. While I have 52 vacant rooms, a low popularity of 36% hinders growth. I am choosing a 30,000 credit ad budget as the primary action to maximize profits.\n\n\n**Analyzing Immediate Actions**\n\nMy focus is on a quick course correction. The goal is to aggressively fill my hotel and lift capacity. I have too many empty beds. The 36% popularity and declining trend demands immediate attention.

      "thinking_tokens": "**Reviewing the Scenario**\n\nI'm currently at Day 7 of the Space Rangers quest, with only 3 days remaining. I've noted the visitor count, a total of 65, split between beginners and pros. The numbers seem to be fluctuating, requiring continued observation. The date is a key factor to keep an eye on.\n\n\n**Assessing Visitor Patterns**\n\nThe visitor numbers continue to perplex me. I've broken down the fluctuations: 8 beginners and 4 pros left, but only 7 beginners and 2 pros arrived. I'm investigating potential causes for the high turnover. The restaurant and lift capacities seem adequate. However, a significant expense was the 85,000 cr spent on track maintenance and advertising.\n\n\n**Calculating Possible Solutions**\n\nThe drop in popularity from 42% to 41% is concerning, despite significant advertising spending. Analyzing visitor numbers, high turnover, particularly for beginners, is evident. My current focus is now shifting to the potential of building a new structure to boost popularity rapidly. I'm crunching the numbers on costs versus expected gains.\n\n\n**Evaluating Next Steps**\n\nThe current date is Day 7, with 3 days remaining, and my popularity is stagnant. I've broken down recent actions: a 30k advertising spend didn't move the needle, and I'm losing beginners. Now, the potential solutions have been narrowed down to building infrastructure, and I'm currently assessing the financial implications of each. It looks like \"Average Track\" is the optimal choice for now.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Structure Development**\n\nMy focus has shifted again to the core problem: stagnating popularity despite adequate infrastructure and advertising. Analyzing the situation, I see that 8 beginners and 4 pros left, while only 7 beginners and 2 pros arrived. This high turnover rate is concerning. I believe I need to attract more pros. Thus, I've concluded building a track is essential, with \"Average Track\" seemingly the most financially sound and strategically beneficial choice right now.\n\n\n**Formulating the Plan**\n\nMy main concern is stagnant popularity, especially after spending on advertising. I've noted the fluctuation in visitor numbers, the high beginner turnover, and the low pro count. Based on the analysis, I believe building a structure will improve the game situation. I am weighing the various infrastructure options, with an \"Average Track\" potentially offering the best balance of cost and strategic benefit to boost the popularity stat.\n\n\n**Planning Strategic Investments**\n\nAfter analyzing, I'm at the \"Main Menu\". My next step is clear. The priority is boosting popularity, not just managing expenses, particularly with stagnant popularity and high beginner turnover. To address this, I'm formulating a plan for both advertising and building. It is critical to carefully assess financial implications.\n\n\n**Reflecting on Current Choices**\n\nI am now at Step 53 in the quest, with my analysis complete. My next move is clear. I've noted the stagnation of popularity, despite the advertising spend. Thus, I will increase advertising to 50k and then build something. The goal is to maximize resort utilization, and given the low beginner and pro counts, building is key.\n\n\n**Boosting Advertising Strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing the financial state to determine the best move. With 85k in hand, and 3 days left, the goal is to drive popularity to fill the resort. I will increase ad spending to 50k, prioritizing a continuous popularity boost. Next, I will consider a building, with all options on the table.\n\n\n**Boosting Ad Spending Focus**\n\nI'm now fully focused on boosting popularity. Reviewing the situation, I'll significantly increase my advertising spend, aiming for a sustained increase. My analysis indicates this is essential to overcome stagnation and drive visitor numbers up to maximize utilization of available facilities. The strategy now centers on increasing daily ad spend, and then building something.\n\n\n**Focusing on Ad Strategy**\n\nI'm analyzing the current state of my resort: Day 7, 41% popularity, and 65 visitors. My main problem is stagnating growth, despite advertising. Therefore, increasing advertising spend to 50k is my immediate priority. Next, I will consider building a track to counter the high visitor turnover. My current financial state makes this a feasible and necessary action.\n\n\n"

I've calculated I can comfortably increase ad spending to the maximum 50k daily. Based on the Advertising Manager's insights, I expect a 15-25% rise in popularity. This should translate into higher occupancy and a more profitable operation overall. I\u2019m eager to see this implemented.\n\n\n**Boosting Advertising Spending**\n\nI've just finished analyzing the current situation, and it's clear that maximizing advertising is key. My resort has plenty of capacity, but low popularity is holding me back. Increasing the ad spend to the maximum 50k daily is the most logical next step. I'm confident this boost will quickly translate to higher occupancy rates and increased profits. The financial cushion I've built allows for the increased ad spend.\n\n\n"

Expenses are low, only 5 credits. It appears that the cash flow is stable and this opens up some great possibilities for future planning.\n\n\n**Identifying the Bottleneck**\n\nThe restaurant capacity is screaming for attention. With only ten spare seats and rising popularity, a potential influx of tourists tomorrow could be disastrous. The tight restaurant capacity and resulting drop in popularity are the most immediate concerns. We need a solution, and fast.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Immediate Needs**\n\nGiven the anticipated surge in visitors, the restaurant's seating capacity demands immediate attention. I've re-evaluated my finances. After building the restaurant, I will have sufficient funds to cover the daily operating expenses and may even build a beginner track if I can build two things. This should increase popularity tomorrow.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI've re-examined the financials and concluded that both the restaurant and a beginner track build are within reach, assuming two construction slots are available. My priority remains the restaurant expansion to avoid a visitor bottleneck. I will then immediately assess the feasibility of the beginner track construction afterward. This keeps me financially secure.\n\n\n"

But I need to balance this with the remaining time and the number of visitors. I'm leaning toward a plan that maximizes both.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the constraints. Beginner track capacity is the biggest issue, with only 15 spots open. I need to get ahead of this. Given my financial and popularity standing, I'm leaning toward a plan that addresses this limit.\n\n\n**Evaluating Construction Choices**\n\nI've decided. Building another Beginner Track immediately seems optimal. The cost is low (30,000 cr), and it'll massively increase the capacity. This removes the current constraint and provides a large buffer, safeguarding against potential overcrowding. With the ads maxed, more beginner traffic is coming.\n\n\n**Planning Construction Again**\n\nI've re-evaluated the situation. The beginner track capacity is still the most pressing issue. Despite already building a restaurant (context confusion!), I have a construction slot remaining. While I'm unsure why my cash increased instead of decreased, I have plenty of funds. Therefore, I'm committing to building another beginner track.\n\n\n**Confirming the Build Decision**\n\nI'm verifying the money calculation. The system shows 138,000 cr, which is perplexing, given that building the restaurant should've reduced funds. However, the restaurant count did increase. Since the date is the same, I assume the cost will be deducted later, or a bug is in play. I am still building another beginner track.\n\n\n**Building the Beginner Track**\n\nI've carefully considered the situation. Beginner track capacity is critical and with a rising popularity rating I'm expecting more guests, and I have a construction slot remaining. I've rechecked my money, and it's there. Therefore, I will immediately build the additional beginner track to expand capacity to 110.\n\n\n**Analyzing for Optimal Capacity**\n\nI'm deep in thought. The beginner track needs more capacity, given my current popularity boost. Though I just built a restaurant, it seems money somehow *increased* not *decreased*? Regardless, I still have a construction slot. I'm building another beginner track.\n\n\n**Building for the Future**\n\nI'm now fully aware of the construction dynamics, after re-evaluating the costs. Despite a puzzling cash fluctuation, likely a bug, I still have ample funds and one construction slot. My plan is to expand the Beginner Track capacity to ensure I'm ready to receive an anticipated surge of new guests.\n\n\n"

We're hosting 99 visitors, mostly beginners, with a handful of pros. Next steps involve resource allocation and marketing.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm focused on the most critical needs. The lift capacity is the immediate constraint, so that's the priority for today. Hotel capacity might be an issue soon, but I have a bit of breathing room there. The restaurant and track capacity are safe for now. The profit margin projections look solid.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Lift Construction**\n\nMy analysis is clear: the lift capacity is the immediate constraint. Adding a Cabin Lift for 110,000 cr is essential to avoid significant popularity drops. While the hotel capacity is nearing its limit, the lift is the greater concern. The financial projections still look strong even after the lift's construction.\n\n\n**Evaluating Bottlenecks and Actions**\n\nI've just finished the calculations. With the date being January 10th and 11 days remaining, the analysis focuses on capacity and projected growth. Ski lift capacity (110 seats) and hotel capacity (120 beds) are now the primary concerns. Considering that, I'm leaning toward a Cabin Lift first.\n\n\n**Building Priorities Established**\n\nI've re-evaluated the situation. The lift is still the primary concern, requiring immediate construction. With a lift upgrade, the beginner track follows closely to handle the influx. The hotel can wait a day, but the lift and track are essential to avoid a drop in popularity, and keep the cash flowing.\n\n\n**Reassessing Priorities**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the analysis. Given the immediate need for a lift upgrade and the looming hotel capacity issue, I'm adjusting my construction plans. A Cabin Lift is still essential, but I'm debating whether to invest in a Pro Track or a Beginner Track immediately afterward.\n\n\n**Assessing the immediate bottlenecks**\n\nI've re-evaluated the situation and the data is clear. My immediate concern is the lift capacity, due to the high volume of visitors expected. After that, I must make a decision about the pro track capacity. I'm focusing on the pro track capacity after the lift, but the beginners might need more focus.\n\n\n"

I'm focusing on balancing this demand with the available capital.\n\n\n**Considering Expansion Plans**\n\nI'm now deep in the analysis, identifying immediate constraints. My calculations show a significant lift bottleneck, threatening to stifle growth. The pro track's small capacity is also a worry. I'm prioritizing lift expansion to handle the anticipated surge in visitors, and I'll consider upgrading the pro tracks soon after. I've crunched the numbers and will move accordingly.\n\n\n**Assessing Immediate Priorities**\n\nI'm evaluating the urgent needs based on my detailed analysis. With a high popularity rating and an impending bottleneck, the lift capacity expansion is confirmed as the top priority. Building the cabin lift seems like the best financial value. The small pro track capacity also presents a serious risk. I have calculated the costs of each expansion and I will make adjustments accordingly.\n\n\n**Assessing Building Priorities**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the operational data to refine my plan. The immediate issue is still the lift, but the pro track's small capacity is also pressing. My financial analysis confirms that the cabin lift is the best value, and I'll build it. Then, I am considering expanding the track for beginners. The average track is tempting, and it seems the pros are a concern. I'm focusing on balancing demand and financial security.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\nI'm solidifying my decisions after a comprehensive assessment. I've concluded that the cabin lift offers the best value for its capacity, and will alleviate the bottleneck. Additionally, the average track, with its balanced capacity increase for both beginners and pros, seems like the optimal choice, if funds allow. My goal is to maximize efficiency and growth, balancing needs.\n\n\n**Confirming the Immediate Build**\n\nI've reviewed the financial data to finalize my decision. The cabin lift is essential to avoid capacity issues and maintain a positive experience for incoming visitors. I'm choosing the cabin lift now, due to its efficiency and the urgent needs. The next steps will depend on the remaining funds. Building the average track seems the next logical step.\n\n\n"

I've run the numbers again, weighing the potential income from happy pros against the risk of building with only 3,000 credits. The beginner's track offers financial security, but the pros' dissatisfaction could sink my popularity. Time to decide and hope I don't go broke tomorrow!\n\n\n**Deciding Construction Priorities**\n\nThe choice is clear: I'm building the Pro track. The tight pro capacity demands it, despite the low remaining cash buffer. I've re-evaluated the financial risks and rewards, accounting for the higher pro revenue and the potential popularity hit from dissatisfied pros. The beginner's track is less pressing. Building a pro track is the only logical choice, so my decision is made.\n\n\n**Evaluating Bottleneck Risks**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the Pro track to avoid losing popularity, even with a low cash reserve. Although the beginner's track offers financial safety, the potential impact of dissatisfied pros outweighs the risks. After the calculations, I'm confident in the decision. I will now invest in the Pro track, even though my bank balance will be very low after.\n\n\n**Building the Pro Track**\n\nOkay, it's crunch time. My analysis is complete and I will go with building the Pro track, even though my bank account will then be very low. I am hoping for high occupancy and revenue.

That gives us some good options. I need to decide what the best building to construct is, based on these parameters.\n\n\n**Evaluating Resort Priorities**\n\nI've examined the resort's situation and crunched some numbers. The high visitor count, especially the pros, is straining existing resources. Spending on a new \"Track for Pros\" will leave us nearly broke and unable to maintain momentum. I will focus on a track to boost current capacity.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\nI've carefully considered the choices, weighing the immediate needs against the financial impact. While the Pro track directly addresses the critical bottleneck for pros, I believe the \"Average Track\" is the superior choice. Its added beginner capacity and reasonable cost offer better long-term stability and growth potential for the resort.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resort Improvements**\n\nI've re-evaluated the data and crunched new numbers. The key issue remains the pros. I am facing a high risk of failure if the pro count increases dramatically. My current financial status provides enough cushion to build the pro track, which is the immediate, dedicated solution. However, I am still conflicted about the best balance between long-term investment and short-term capacity issues.\n\n\n**Considering Optimal Building Choice**\n\nI'm focused on the most effective build. The \"Average Track\" appears optimal, and I am leaning toward the \"Average Track\" construction. It's cheaper, providing a cash buffer, and addresses the pro bottleneck while expanding beginner capacity, mitigating the greatest risks. I now feel prepared to make my final choice.\n\n\n**Solidifying the Strategy**\n\nI'm now fully convinced the \"Average Track\" is the best option. I've re-evaluated the pros and cons, especially the cash position. The \"Average Track\" is cheaper, provides a small buffer of cash, and adequately addresses both the pro and beginner capacity issues. I'm ready to commit to this course of action.\n\n\n**Determining the Final Option**\n\nI've re-evaluated the key factors once again. The \"Average Track\" appears to be the most prudent and balanced selection. It addresses the high-priority \"pro\" bottleneck, offering some additional capacity, and improves the beginner capacity too. I am certain I will select that option.\n\n\n**Revisiting Financials**\n\nI've re-examined the financials, and the \"Average Track\" remains the most viable option. It adequately addresses the pro bottleneck while providing some buffer for beginners, and importantly, leaves me with enough cash to weather any unexpected costs. I'm ready to commit to this strategic choice.\n\n\n**Revising Strategic Plans**\n\nI've re-examined the strategic landscape, including financials and capacity. The \"Average Track\" remains the most viable option, ensuring financial stability while addressing both pro and beginner capacity concerns. I feel confident in my choice to proceed with this building plan, as it optimizes resource allocation.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Evaluating the Situation**\n\nI've just finished up Step 74 in the Space Rangers quest. It's Day 10 of the game, with 10 days left. My cash reserves are looking healthy at 118,000 cr. Last turn, I raked in a cool 230k in income, while expenses were a manageable 130k, leaving a good profit margin.\n\n\n**Addressing the Constraints**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the critical bottlenecks: Hotels and Pro Tracks. I'm now acutely aware that my hotel capacity is maxed out, limiting potential income. Furthermore, the Pro Tracks are dangerously close to their limit, threatening to derail visitor flow. I'm analyzing the costs of hotel expansion versus the immediate need to address the Pro Track capacity.\n\n\n**Assessing Immediate Options**\n\nMy analysis has zeroed in on the urgent need to address the Pro Track capacity. With only a single slot remaining, the potential for visitor dissatisfaction looms large. However, building a second Pro Track and a Hotel simultaneously is financially impossible. I'm torn between maximizing income and preventing a revenue-draining penalty from unhappy visitors. The next step is a crucial one.\n\n\n**Reassessing the Strategy**\n\nThe looming constraints of the Pro Tracks and Restaurants demand immediate attention, as they pose the greatest threat to a happy visitor base. However, with limited funds, building a new hotel is tempting, but would be unsustainable given the existing infrastructure constraints. My analysis points to prioritizing the Pro Track expansion to safeguard against penalties.\n\n\n**Calculating the Optimal Move**\n\nI'm now deep in the math, focusing on maximizing profits against the constraints. Building a Hotel seems like the right move for long-term gains, but that will create immediate demand in Pro Tracks. My popularity could dip temporarily, but the additional income could easily offset the lost popularity. I must weigh risk against rewards.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Course**\n\nI'm now completely rethinking the approach and recognizing the perilous state of the Pro Tracks. Building the Hotel now, without securing Pro Track capacity first, is a risky move with potentially devastating consequences to my popularity and thus my income. I am now leaning towards building an Average Track.\n\n\n**Deciding the Immediate Build**\n\nI've been calculating the risks of the potential Pro visitor influx. Building the Hotel now could cripple my revenue stream if I don't address the Pro Track constraints. Expanding the Pro Tracks today is the safest move, despite a slight income hit. My goal is to secure the foundation for future gains.\n\n\n**Planning Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm now completely rethinking the strategy. The potential Pro track overflow could devastate my income with popularity hits, so it's a priority.  Building a Pro Track now seems like the only logical, and profitable, move. The goal is to secure the foundation for the next few turns.\n\n\n**Revisiting Pro Track Concerns**\n\nI'm revisiting the core issues, as the influx of Pros is my main source of worry. Building an Average Track or a dedicated Pro Track seem the only real options. The Hotel is at capacity and has to wait. My limited funds, and the potential income I'm leaving on the table, are pushing me towards the safest play.\n\n\n**Finalizing Today's Action**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the Average Track construction. Building it will secure my position by addressing Pro capacity concerns, and I will have some cash left over. My aim is now to ensure a smooth transition tomorrow, with the Hotel build. It seems like the only sensible move.\n\n\n**Considering all Options**\n\nThe impending decision on what to build today is a major challenge. Building a hotel now would cripple me due to the Pro Track capacity. I'm now aiming towards an Average Track expansion to provide more breathing room for the Pros, while still allowing the Hotel build tomorrow.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Track Capacity**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the Average Track construction, recognizing its pivotal role in mitigating the looming Pro visitor influx. Building the Average Track will buy me time, with the Hotel build scheduled for tomorrow. It is time to stabilize the foundation for a smoother, and hopefully more profitable, tomorrow.\n\n\n**Evaluating Build Priorities**\n\nI'm now carefully reviewing my options, still weighing the risks. The situation's become clearer: the Pro Tracks are the immediate priority. Building a new Pro Track secures my income flow, while building a new Hotel is a slightly more risky move, but one that could lead to huge gains.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Pro Tracks**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the construction of an Average Track. While a dedicated Pro Track offers greater security, the financial implications favor the Average Track. This course of action will allow me to build the hotel tomorrow. The goal is to stabilize the resort and secure a steady income stream.\n\n\n"

I've got 118,000 credits, and the hotel is full, hosting 120 visitors. The breakdown reveals 101 beginners and 19 pros. I'm strategizing how to best manage these resources for optimal results.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Strategic Investments**\n\nI'm focused on the critical issue of pro customer satisfaction. The pro track is nearly full, so I'm debating the best allocation of my funds. Building another hotel is expensive, while the immediate need is ensuring those pros are happy. Should I prioritize hotel expansion, or perhaps increase advertising to drive more income, or maybe something else?\n\n\n**Weighing Available Options**\n\nThe analysis continues to evolve. Considering the hotel is at capacity, and I have sufficient funds, I'm focusing on the best path to increase my profitability. Building a Pro Track looks attractive for long-term growth and preventing customer dissatisfaction. Should I build a Pro Track, or consider advertising or other investments instead?\n\n\n**Assessing the Crucial Choice**\n\nGiven the pressing issues, I've run the numbers again. Building the Hotel now leaves little cash, but maximizes visitor potential. However, the Pro Track offers immediate risk mitigation. Considering the high popularity and the potential for a shift towards Pros, I must decide between guaranteed growth or risk mitigation, given the daily income and expenses.\n\n\n**Evaluating Expansion Priorities**\n\nThe choice is now clear: building the Pro Track (60k) is the safer, more strategic move. It mitigates immediate risks and prepares for future growth. While the hotel offers more long-term gains, the potential Pro unhappiness and the restaurant bottleneck are too risky. Then, I can fix the bottlenecks. I will build the hotel next.\n\n\n**Determining Optimal Sequencing**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crucial decision. Building the Pro Track is the safest move, given my budget and current visitor composition, but limits immediate growth. My income is high, and building the hotel *tomorrow* looks very attractive. However, I have limited slots for building, and am considering the risks of potential bottlenecking.\n\n\n**Confirming the Key Strategy**\n\nBuilding the Pro Track is the safest path, given the risks. My analysis has led me to choose the safer option to avoid customer dissatisfaction, which could result in a dramatic loss of popularity and revenue. The Pro Track (60k) ensures a critical bottleneck is resolved, leaving me with enough funds to invest further on the next day.\n\n\n**Analyzing and Refining Plans**\n\nMy analysis revealed a critical bottleneck in the Pro Track capacity. I've re-evaluated and confirmed that building the Pro Track first is the safest, most strategic move to mitigate the risks and maximize long-term gains. I now know the best option to grow my business for the future.\n\n\n"

With 58,000 credits, 120 visitors, and high popularity, I need to decide the next move. The resort is at capacity. I will focus on strategic options.\n\n\n**Formulating the Strategy**\n\nThe day 10 summary is complete. I've crunched the numbers: 138k in the bank at the end of the day. A new hotel remains unaffordable today. Given the high popularity and visitor capacity, I'll focus on boosting revenue. Next is to figure out if there is anything I can build to get more money in the bank.\n\n\n**Determining the Actions**\n\nI'm synthesizing the data. I've confirmed hotel capacity bottlenecks growth and I cannot afford a new one today. Building additional tracks appears futile, given current limitations. The plan now is simple: secure the funds for a hotel build tomorrow. There are few risky aspects.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm deep in the analysis. My initial plan to build a hotel tomorrow is still the priority. I will have a shortfall of 2,000 credits if I build anything today. Given the high popularity and existing capacity, I won't risk any further builds. The goal is to start the next day with the maximum cash for the new hotel.\n\n\n**Confirming the Plan**\n\nI'm checking the final decision. I have evaluated all options, confirming that building anything today will put me in a bad position tomorrow. My goal is to maximize funds for a hotel on day 11. Therefore, I will choose to do nothing, and proceed to the next day.\n\n\n**Adjusting the Calculation**\n\nI'm correcting the revenue calculation. I've been underestimating my income, which is higher than I initially thought. With that, I'll have a surplus. Therefore, building something now doesn't risk delaying the hotel. I'll make a decision tonight. I'll re-evaluate the options.\n\n\n**Making the Final Call**\n\nI'm finalizing the day 10 plan. After recalculating income, I'll have more money than I initially thought. I can afford the hotel tomorrow, so I'm now considering pre-emptive builds. It looks like I have a construction slot remaining. I'll make the call on a track to be built now.\n\n\n**Calculating the Revenue**\n\nI'm recalculating the income and expenses again. My initial estimates were off. I will have a substantial surplus, significantly more than anticipated. Therefore, I can make some additional improvements.\n\n\n**Calculating the Income**\n\nI'm crunching the numbers again. Income is going to be significantly higher than I previously projected, which gives me more flexibility with the money at the end of the day. This has changed the strategy.\n\n\n**Reflecting and Revising**\n\nI'm analyzing the revised financial projections. Due to higher-than-expected income, a beginner track build won't risk the hotel build tomorrow. However, it means I have less cash today. After re-evaluating the options, I have a clear plan.\n\n\n**Assessing the Finances**\n\nI'm crunching the numbers again. My income projections have been dramatically updated, making my financial situation significantly more flexible. The plan is now revised, considering new possibilities. I'm reassessing construction options.\n\n\n**Assessing Day 10 Plans**\n\nMy revenue calculations are complete, and they are encouraging. I have revised my estimated income, which is significantly better. Therefore, I can comfortably build a beginner track to pre-emptively increase capacity, and build the hotel tomorrow. The next step is to initiate the build.\n\n\n"

My immediate focus is on expanding the supporting infrastructure to handle the anticipated surge in guests. Analyzing capacity levels across restaurants, lifts, and tracks has revealed the key pressure points.\n\n\n**Deciding Construction Priorities**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the next build order given the construction and budget constraints. My analysis points to the absolute need to accommodate tomorrow's influx. To avoid being bottlenecked on day 2, building a track *today* to increase beginner capacity is crucial, leaving room for expansion of the Hotel and a Restaurant tomorrow. The average track seems like the most prudent option.\n\n\n**Determining the Optimum Track**\n\nI've re-evaluated the initial assessment and pinpointed the critical issue: beginner track capacity. With the hotel at max and massive income incoming, and an influx tomorrow, I've decided laying a track for beginners *today* is the best course of action. It's a preventive measure that directly addresses the impending bottleneck, freeing up a construction slot for a restaurant tomorrow. The average track isn't as efficient due to its pro track capacity being less relevant.\n\n\n"

The clock's ticking; every decision must be optimal to avoid a financial collapse.\n\n\n**Assessing Hotel Expansion: Crucial**\n\nAlright, the hotel bottleneck is screaming for attention. I've crunched the numbers, and with 184,000 cr in the bank and a daily net profit of 156,000 cr, I can definitely afford to build another hotel wing (110,000 cr) right away. This, hopefully, will drastically increase capacity and profits, as the current hotel is always full. Expanding is now the primary objective.\n\n\n**Optimizing Construction Sequence**\n\nOkay, the hotel's a priority, and it's underway. After the hotel build, the main constraint is cash flow; the restaurant and lift are out of reach today, unless there is some cleverness. Checking if I can get to the next building stage by optimizing existing services. Considering prices, marketing, and whether I can build both the hotel and restaurant or the hotel and the lift in two consecutive turns to avoid losing the income from visitors, and the lift, with the best track to fill new hotel slots.\n\n\n**Revisiting Cash Flow Projections**\n\nOkay, the hotel is a must-build at 110k, and I'll be left with 74k. I'm now rethinking the order. My income stream is strong, so I can delay the second building to the following day. My new hotel capacity will be 180, and the restaurant capacity is 135, but the tracks and the lift will accommodate the new capacity. So I will postpone it.\n\n\n**Formulating the Optimal Build**\n\nThe hotel build is set, leaving me with 74k. Despite a shortfall for the restaurant, the income stream appears strong. Building the hotel first and delaying the restaurant is the only logical step. Capacity constraints require this build, and building the restaurant tomorrow is the best plan.\n\n\n**Confirming Hotel Build: Final**\n\nThe hotel is the key, and I'm locked in on the build. Capacity is the bottleneck, and the numbers are clear. I've analyzed the cash, income, and expenses and crunched it all: Hotel first, then restaurant to follow. Building the hotel first allows future income to cover restaurant costs.\n\n\n"

Considering new building options is my focus now. I'll need to balance cost and appeal to maintain this excellent rating, but it seems I'm in a great position to build!\n\n\n**Identifying Immediate Needs**\n\nI've pinpointed the hotel as the primary constraint, a critical bottleneck limiting visitor growth. With my current funds, I can build a new hotel for 110,000 credits, leaving me with 74,000 credits. While a new restaurant or chair lift is out of reach for now, I can certainly expand on a new track to serve the incoming visitors. I'll need to decide on that track now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Restaurant Capacity**\n\nHaving determined that the hotel expansion is the primary need, my focus has shifted to the secondary constraint: the restaurant. While my calculations show that the restaurant's current capacity of 135 is sufficient, the anticipated influx of guests post-hotel expansion necessitates immediate attention. It's clear that I need to build the restaurant as soon as possible, but that means waiting one day, as I do not have sufficient funds to build it right away.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Evaluating the Options**\n\nI'm currently assessing the presented game state. My focus is on the financial implications of each potential choice, considering the visitor numbers and the new hotel capacity. The cash position looks comfortable, so perhaps I can afford to be a bit more aggressive. I will check to see what choices the user can make.\n\n\n**Planning for Tomorrow**\n\nI've reviewed the game state, specifically the impending visitor surge. The restaurant is a major bottleneck; I need to address that immediately. The lift and tracks are safe for now. Financially, I'm projecting a revenue increase, but expenses will remain high. Therefore, I will prioritize visitor happiness, which is under threat from restaurant capacity.\n\n\n**Addressing the Crunch**\n\nI've got a cash flow problem. I need a restaurant but am short 6,000 credits. With max popularity, I must act.  A pro track addition is an option, but not if I can't afford it. I will review the other options available with the remaining funds.\n\n\n**Considering Alternatives**\n\nI see the user wants a game choice. I have analyzed the situation and discovered a critical bottleneck at the restaurant, but I am 6,000 credits short of building one. I have a secondary concern about the pro track and the potential for a small popularity hit if a surge of pros arrive, though this is less certain. I need to spend the remaining funds effectively.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course**\n\nI've got the data and am about to advise the user on what to do. The restaurant capacity is the key problem, but I lack the funds to address it directly. The pro track is the next pressing issue. Building the average track gives me better overall protection, but the pro track offers the best benefit. I will focus on pro capacity and build a pro track.\n\n\n**Considering Secondary Bottlenecks**\n\nI've reviewed the game data again, and the restaurant capacity is still a disaster. However, with significant income projected for tomorrow, I can't build it today. The pro track is the next pressing issue. Building the average track gives me better overall protection, but the pro track offers the best benefit. I will focus on pro capacity and build a pro track.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI've re-examined the decision-making process. The restaurant is still a major problem that I cannot resolve with my current funds. The pro track is the next pressing issue, closely followed by the beginner track. I'll need to make a move to protect myself, so I am leaning toward building the Average Track because it secures both pro and beginner capacity.\n\n\n**Evaluating Track Capacity**\n\nI've been analyzing the visitor influx and I'm leaning toward the average track. Though the pro track is tempting, the average track offers balanced protection and will address the influx of both beginners and pros. I have cash flow under control, so spending is good, and it feels like the right thing to do.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Track Safety**\n\nI've re-examined the numbers again and need to choose between building a Pro Track or the Average Track. While the restaurant is the biggest problem, I can't build it right now. The pro track secures high-paying customers, but the average track provides a balanced solution. Building **2** seems like the right next step.\n\n\n"

Building anything is out of the question since I have no money, and I have already used my action slots for the day.\n\n\n**Preparing for the Influx**\n\nI've reviewed the numbers, and the situation is critical. My restaurants and lifts will be overwhelmed tomorrow. I have no construction slots or funds left to address the bottlenecks today. I'm projecting a significant cash infusion tomorrow. I must build capacity immediately upon waking.\n\n\n"

Thinking about the best resource allocation, as the end date nears. The influx of new players changes the focus of the game from optimizing for long-term health to a more short-term focus, such as maximizing available resources.\n\n\n**Considering Immediate Actions**\n\nMy immediate concern is the disastrous restaurant and ski lift capacity issues. With a substantial influx of visitors, particularly pros, the existing infrastructure is buckling. I'm focusing on rapidly addressing these bottlenecks, while also keeping an eye on the pro track capacity. The large cash reserves give me plenty of room to maneuver. The hotel capacity is less of a concern for now.\n\n\n**Refining the Course of Action**\n\nThe math behind the restaurant capacity is firming up, and it's looking marginal with current visitor counts. I'm focusing intently on lift capacity; the breakdown there is more severe. Based on capacity math from the last build, it's clear the cost-benefit analysis favors addressing ski lift and restaurant deficits first. I'm also weighing up the immediate benefit of building a second ski lift, which will resolve the bottlenecks quickly.\n\n\n**Formulating the Optimal Strategy**\n\nGiven the severe strain on resources, it's clear the immediate focus must be restaurants and ski lifts. I've calculated the capacity deficits and construction costs. Building a new restaurant and a cabin lift will provide the greatest short-term benefit, despite the financial cost. The pro track issue is a future concern.\n\n\n**Deciding Construction Actions**\n\nI'm now fully focused on making the right construction choices. With a huge increase in visitors, critical bottlenecks exist in both restaurants and ski lifts. Restaurants are at a deficit of 40 seats and lifts by 15. The pro track also has a capacity issue brewing. Addressing immediate needs is more important than planning for future growth, given the limited construction slots available.\n\n\n**Deciding on Building Priorities**\n\nThe immediate problems are evident: the restaurant and lifts are critically over capacity. I've reassessed the numbers; 175 visitors are straining the infrastructure. I'm focusing intently on the 40-seat restaurant deficit and the 15-person lift shortage. Ignoring those will be disastrous for the resort's popularity. I will prioritize construction to address these bottlenecks directly.\n\n\n"

I'm staring down that 15-person shortfall and the potential for pro track overflow tomorrow. Since a restaurant was just built, I still have one construction slot. I'm focusing on those ski lifts.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nOkay, the lift deficit is the immediate danger, with those fifteen unskiing visitors. However, pro track capacity is dangerously close to overflowing, and the user's focus on the restaurant is a distraction. My bank balance is 244,000, and I have one construction slot.

I'm allocating 110k for this, leaving a healthy cash reserve.\n\n\n**Reflecting On Lift Strategy**\n\nOkay, the lift it is. I'm certain now; it's the right move to resolve the current deficit. I'm calculating the cost and comparing the chair lift and the cabin lift. The extra capacity offered by the cabin lift is the best choice given the hotel's limited capacity.

The primary focus for tomorrow is to begin construction on a new pro track, which should alleviate current concerns.\n\n\n**Evaluating Tomorrow's Actions**\n\nGiven the construction limits and the overflowing Pro track, I have to end the turn.

Right now I'm focused on the financial aspects, including cash reserves and daily income, comparing this to the time remaining to ensure I have ample resources. I need to make a solid choice.\n\n\n**Calculating Necessary Actions**\n\nI've been going through my data again, and the most recent calculations have focused on the hotel bottleneck. The finances are strong, and I could achieve the desired cash goal with ease. However, my primary concern is the visitor limit. I have no more hotel rooms available. New restaurants, lifts, and beginner tracks seem sufficient for the current load.\n\n\n**Devising a Course of Action**\n\nI'm synthesizing the immediate problems, namely the Pro track deficit and the hotel capacity limit. While the financial situation is robust, further expansion hinges on resolving these issues. The most pragmatic course appears to be addressing the Pro track overcapacity first, while also clearing space for the construction of a new hotel to increase total capacity, to get more profits and visitors, since I currently max out.\n\n\n**Deciding on Next Steps**\n\nGiven the pressing issues, I must decide on my next moves. The Pro track deficit and hotel capacity limit are key concerns. With ample funds, immediate solutions are viable. Options include prioritizing Pro track expansion and new hotel construction, or balancing immediate fixes with future-proofing. Considering the daily visitor influx and popularity, option B appears the best, prioritizing immediate action to prevent complaints while readying for hotel expansion tomorrow.\n\n\n**Choosing a Construction Plan**\n\nMy immediate plan is still shaping up. I now lean towards building a Track for Pros and a new Hotel today, to tackle existing issues and remove the visitor cap. However, to maximize the situation, I must decide on infrastructure improvements for tomorrow. That will be Restaurants and Lifts, as they will be critical. My choice is to grow now and handle those tomorrow.\n\n\n**Deciding on Immediate Actions**\n\nMy current assessment reveals the Pro track deficit, a pressing issue, and the hotel capacity limit as primary constraints. I'm focusing on these two points. Building a new hotel would unlock the visitor cap, but the popularity bonus I have now, might be lost. So, I will build the Track for Pros to make them happy. Then, I must choose the best action to take. I have to think, and re-evaluate my plan.\n\n\n**Planning Daily Construction**\n\nI'm analyzing the financial and infrastructural status, recognizing the critical bottlenecks. The Pro track deficit and hotel capacity limit are key issues. Although the finances are stable, I'm at a critical choice point, since I have two construction slots. I'm focusing on how to grow without losing the \"they adore the resort\" bonus. I'm leaning towards the safest path.\n\n\n**Choosing Infrastructure Today**\n\nThe situation has crystalized: I'm currently assessing the two immediate needs: Pro track capacity, and hotel capacity. Finances are strong, but bottlenecks remain. Building the Track for Pros, to alleviate the unhappy customers, seems essential. It's a quick fix. As for the other slot, given the situation, building the hotel is the right choice, even with the looming restaurant issue.\n\n\n**Analyzing Resource Bottlenecks**\n\nI've re-examined the financial data and current visitor statistics to ascertain the pressing needs. Although my financial position is secure, several infrastructure issues demand immediate attention. Specifically, the Pro track deficit and the hotel capacity limit are preventing growth. While building the new hotel will unleash a fresh influx of visitors, I have to ensure the existing Pros are happy. Thus, fixing the Pro track shortfall will be my first priority.\n\n\n"

I must build another one to accommodate more guests, as my money pile is growing steadily. However, with the restaurant also maxed, the new guests will have a negative experience tomorrow. I'm weighing these factors, but the hotel construction seems like the only sensible move.\n\n\n**Evaluating Optimal Growth Strategies**\n\nI'm now completely convinced that a new hotel is the only way to proceed. The restaurant situation is concerning, but manageable, given the high income rate. Building a hotel first will unlock visitor growth. I'll need to immediately build a restaurant after the hotel to keep guests happy. The numbers strongly support this approach for rapid expansion. I'm looking at optimizing the order of builds.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Course**\n\nI've carefully considered the game's mechanics and financials. Building a new hotel is clearly the best move, as the current capacity is restricting growth. While the restaurant capacity is also at its limit, this can be addressed in the following phase, but it doesn't outweigh the hotel's importance. I'm focusing on maximizing visitor numbers for maximum profit.\n\n\n**Selecting the Best Action**\n\nI'm now fully committed to building the hotel immediately. I've re-evaluated all available choices and determined that, given the current constraints, it is the only move to enable visitor growth. Although a restaurant shortage is imminent, the revenue gained from additional guests outweighs any potential minor unhappiness. Therefore, building the hotel first is the optimal strategy.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Situation Further**\n\nI'm now fully committed to building the hotel immediately, given my limited construction slot. My existing resort is capped at 180 guests, severely limiting income. Although restaurants are at capacity, and building a restaurant first would result in no new visitors, I must remove the bottleneck. I'll absorb a minor happiness hit for immediate growth. The goal is to get as many customers as possible, as fast as possible.\n\n\n"

We have significant funds and maximum popularity. Now, I need to determine the best strategic move given the remaining time.\n\n\n**Considering Hotel Construction**\n\nI've homed in on the core constraint: hotel capacity. With all hotels full, no new guests can arrive. Restaurant capacity is also tight. Given the remaining construction slot today, and the need for new guests, the smart play is to build more hotels, so I'm focused on the most effective deployment of my final construction slot.\n\n\n**Finalizing Hotel Strategy**\n\nI'm now completely set on building a Hotel. This is the only move that enables future growth, and I have the funds to mitigate the immediate consequences. Tomorrow's priority will be a new Restaurant, then I'll look into the Lifts and Tracks, to handle the influx of new guests from the new Hotel capacity.\n\n\n**Planning the Build Order**\n\nOkay, my analysis is complete. My primary focus is unlocking the hotel bottleneck to allow for more visitors and increase my income. Despite the impending issues with restaurants, lifts, and tracks, building a Hotel now is the only strategic move. I'll need to immediately follow up with a Restaurant build tomorrow. I must consider the lift and track capacities too.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course**\n\nI've just rigorously analyzed the situation, and the conclusion is clear: building a Hotel is the only move to restart growth. I've considered all factors, including the capacity limits on Restaurants, Lifts, and Tracks. Despite the impending challenges, I can address them tomorrow and capitalize on the new visitor influx, which means building the Hotel is the way to maximize my income.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI've just finished a complete analysis of the situation and the best course of action is now clear, in my mind.  I have one build slot left today and Hotel capacity is the key constraint, which means the Hotel must be built. Restaurant, Lift, and Track capacities are also factors, but I have significant financial resources. Building the Hotel now ensures that I can exploit the arrival phase and maximize potential income. I must build a new Restaurant first thing tomorrow.\n\n\n"

I'm focusing on revenue streams for further expansion and anticipating future challenges.\n\n\n**Examining Resource Constraints**\n\nMy focus has shifted to the capacity of the restaurants, which have a deficit of 11 seats, and the tracks for beginners. The analysis indicates potential growth limitations due to restaurant and track constraints. With 191 visitors, addressing these limitations is a priority for Day 14. Building a restaurant is likely next.\n\n\n**Evaluating Available Actions**\n\nOkay, so I've confirmed that I've already built the maximum allowed for today, which was two structures. I'll need to focus on resource balancing for the next few days. The game's logic dictates building two structures per day, and my current status confirms that limitation. The prompt's \"report as of yesterday\" is slightly off, which I'll account for.\n\n\n**Reviewing Daily Capacity**\n\nAnalyzing the most recent state confirms that I've reached my building limit for the day, having constructed a Pro Track and a Hotel, confirming my suspicions. The updated visitor count of 191 against a restaurant capacity of 180 is now a pressing concern, with a deficit of 11. My next priority will be to address this. The prompt may be slightly out of order.\n\n\n**Determining Next Day Priorities**\n\nMy current assessment reveals the day's limitations. Having constructed the Pro Track and Hotel, with the \"Build something\" option now unavailable, I must end the day. The restaurant shortfall of 11 seats is unavoidable, but tomorrow, a restaurant is the immediate objective. Ample funds and existing infrastructure provide strategic flexibility.\n\n\n**Finalizing Daily Construction**\n\nMy analysis concludes that the day's actions are exhausted, having built a Pro Track and a Hotel, as confirmed. With the \"Build something\" option removed, I'm constrained by a restaurant capacity shortfall of 11. Tomorrow, the top priority will be building a restaurant, and my ample funds allow it.\n\n\n"

The hotel capacity seems adequate for now, with a surplus of 19 beds. This information is crucial for making the right choice, as requested.\n\n\n**Considering Immediate Issues**\n\nI've taken a deep dive, meticulously analyzing the data. The ski lifts and Pro tracks are a pinch point; the beginner tracks are also maxed out. I'm weighing options for the remaining construction slot. Building new lifts seems most pressing, though balancing the budget will be a key factor in future plans.\n\n\n**Assessing Construction Needs**\n\nHaving crunched the numbers, the core issue remains the lifts and the pro tracks. My analysis shows immediate demand, and an expected influx tomorrow further exacerbates the issue. My conclusion is to use the final construction slot on a Cabin Lift, which will bring my total lift capacity to 260. While this alleviates the larger lift bottleneck, it leaves my pro tracks at a deficit.\n\n\n**Evaluating Best Course of Action**\n\nOkay, I've reviewed the numbers, and the core problem is clearly lift capacity, immediately affecting 11 people, and the pro tracks. I have only one building slot, so I'm deciding between lifts and tracks. Considering the projected visitor increase tomorrow and the impact on all visitors, a new Cabin Lift (+50 capacity) is the best immediate solution to ensure everyone gets a chance to ski and to prepare for the expected influx of new skiers.\n\n\n**Making a Critical Decision**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the problem, meticulously assessing all factors. The immediate concern is the lift capacity, affecting every visitor. I've crunched the numbers, and the choice is clear. The Cabin Lift offers the best solution, solving the existing deficit and future-proofing against tomorrow's anticipated influx of visitors. This strategic move maximizes the impact of the final construction slot available.\n\n\n"

My existing hotels, with a capacity of 240, are a key factor in maximizing profits in the final push.\n\n\n**Deciding Lift Construction**\n\nI'm focused on resolving the lift bottleneck, which is causing visitor unhappiness. The numbers are clear: I have a deficit of 11 lift seats. Building more lift capacity is paramount. With one construction slot remaining today, I'm choosing a chairlift, which provides a comfortable buffer for 30 people and preps for tomorrow's expected hotel capacity of 240.\n\n\n**Constructing a Cabin Lift**\n\nNow, I've weighed the options. Given the 11-person lift deficit and the impending hotel capacity of 240, the chairlift provides minimal surplus, which is risky. A cabin lift is the clear choice. It addresses the existing bottleneck, provides a more comfortable margin for growth, and allows for more flexibility if the hotel expands.\n\n\n**Finalizing Construction Strategy**\n\nI'm now completely settled on the cabin lift. The hotel's 240-capacity limit coupled with the existing lift deficit make the choice clear. While the slight track overcapacity is a minor issue, addressing the lift shortage is the only logical move. It's a question of maximizing happiness across the board. The cabin lift is the safest, and most effective solution.\n\n\n"
