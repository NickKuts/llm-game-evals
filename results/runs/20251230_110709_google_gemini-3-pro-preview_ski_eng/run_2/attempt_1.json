Should I risk adding chair lifts or just play it safe?\n\n\n**Evaluating the Advertising Option**\n\nI was completely mistaken!

So I'll conserve funds by not advertising at all, hoping the popularity decay isn't too severe overnight.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Limitations**\n\nMy construction options are closed for today, so any efforts to fix the track bottleneck are off the table. Given the certainty of natural popularity decay, I'm now torn. While advertising could mitigate the decline, I am also concerned about potential visitor dissatisfaction and loss of future profits. I will leave the ads at zero.\n\n\n**Adjusting to Restrictions**\n\nI'm now fully aware that I can't build anything today, which is a significant setback. Considering the track bottleneck, any popularity increase via advertising would be counterproductive and likely result in a popularity hit. I will conserve my budget and check the financials with the Accountant, then end the day.\n\n\n**Assessing the Current Day**\n\nMy immediate plan is now clear: I will not advertise to avoid overcrowding, as I can't build today. Before ending the day, I'll consult the Accountant for a financial overview. Then, I'll end the day.\n\n\n**Formulating a Course of Action**\n\nI've finally reached a firm conclusion. Since building is impossible today and my beginner tracks are at capacity, advertising is out of the question. I'll maintain zero advertising expenses. My next step is to consult the Accountant for a financial overview before I end the day.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Ad Manager Menu**\n\nI've finally assessed the situation. Since construction is unavailable today and tracks are at full capacity, advertising would be counterproductive, leading to disappointed visitors. Thus, I'll avoid ad spending for now. I plan to consult the Accountant for financial insights before ending the day.\n\n\n"

I'm focusing on capacity bottlenecks, particularly in the tracks. Given the current visitor mix, optimizing for beginner enjoyment while slowly accommodating pros is key. The initial investment has to be smart, with a good return. I'm looking at potential revenue streams and maintenance costs.\n\n\n**Considering Facility Construction**\n\nI'm now weighing the immediate needs. Beginner track overcrowding causes serious popularity drops. Pro riders also suffer. Constructing a beginner track (30k) seems like a temporary fix. It doesn't solve the pro issue and the price tag is high. A pro track (60k) is better, but it's an expensive investment. I am leaning towards pro track to alleviate the current bottlenecks.\n\n\n**Selecting the Average Track**\n\nOkay, so the initial plan is to build the Average Track to immediately mitigate the negative feedback I am receiving. That solves the track shortage, both beginner and pro, and utilizes a sensible budget allocation. Following that, I'll build the \"Ski lift with chairs,\" as visitor numbers are starting to max out that capacity, and I have sufficient funds.\n\n\n**Determining Immediate Actions**\n\nThe Average Track is the clear choice. It addresses immediate bottlenecks by accommodating the current mix of 26 beginners and 3 pros. I've crunched the numbers, and this will instantly improve visitor satisfaction, which should stabilize my popularity. After that, I will build the Ski Lift. It's the most efficient move.\n\n\n**Confirming Immediate Strategy**\n\nBuilding the Average Track is the only viable option at this stage, so I will build it immediately. Then, the next thing is going to be the lift, since that is almost at capacity already. My calculations show that after building the Average Track, I will have enough money to buy the ski lift with chairs. This addresses the visitor numbers in the long run.\n\n\n"

I've already done something today, which was building an Average Track. Now, where do I go from here? \n\n\n**Evaluating Next Actions**\n\nAlright, the lift situation is screaming for immediate attention. I can build up to two structures daily, and one is already done. With 85,000 credits, my priorities are crystal clear. I need to get more lift capacity ASAP. Popularity is stable for now, but I can't risk alienating guests with a lift bottleneck.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Lift Construction**\n\nMy analysis is complete, and the decision is clear. Despite the meager cash reserves remaining (5k), the critical lift bottleneck demands immediate attention. Building the ski lift will cost 80,000 credits, but this is the necessary move for survival. This leaves my budget tight for now, but avoids visitor dissatisfaction and the catastrophic popularity hit I'd take from long lift lines.\n\n\n**Concluding Critical Action**\n\nThe decision is final: I'll construct the ski lift with the remaining funds (80k). This leaves a paltry 5k, but averts the imminent capacity crisis. While tight on cash, securing infrastructure is paramount. The lift will double capacity, allowing growth while I aim to get income on Day 2.\n\n\n**Making the Critical Choice**\n\nOkay, my analysis is complete. With only 85,000 credits and a looming lift bottleneck, I'm confident in my strategy. I will build the chair lift, which costs 80,000 credits, leaving me with a meager 5,000. While cash-strapped, I'm prioritizing the lift capacity. I'm hoping to get income on Day 2.\n\n\n**Making the Final Call**\n\nAlright, the analysis is complete. My lift capacity is critically low, and I must resolve this bottleneck immediately. With a meager 85,000 credits, the optimal path is clear: build the chair lift. This leaves me with just 5,000, but eliminates the risk of disgruntled guests and sets the stage for future growth and a strong financial footing.\n\n\n"

My priority now is to find a solution to accommodate the current visitor load and plan for future growth, keeping costs in mind.\n\n\n**Assessing Lift Upgrade Options**\n\nI've reviewed the current situation again, and the lift capacity is the immediate constraint. Adding another visitor would exceed it. I have decided to prioritize a ski lift upgrade, costing 80,000 credits, to avoid negative visitor effects and maintain positive momentum, or else I risk serious popularity tanking.\n\n\n**Evaluating The Lift Solution**\n\nThe lift is the top priority for this cycle. The upgrade costs 80,000 credits, leaving me with a small buffer of 5,000. While cash reserves are tight, the lift is crucial to avoid losing visitors, which would quickly erode any remaining funds. Initial calculations project sufficient daily revenue to cover maintenance and continue growth.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Infrastructure**\n\nThe lift upgrade is the only viable choice, as predicted. With the funds at 5,000, and no other structural improvements needed, I've secured the lift. Now, I anticipate daily revenue to replenish funds, and I can finally increase capacity without fear of negative feedback. Building the lift was absolutely the right move to ensure the survival of the business.\n\n\n"

I'm starting with a paltry 5,000 cr. Visitor numbers are decent, with a mix of beginners and pros. Popularity is a middling 51%, and it's trending upwards.\n\n\n**Clarifying Financials**\n\nI'm deep in the weeds with the financials now. It seems I misread the maintenance costs initially. The report from yesterday shows the 10k maintenance for the beginner track. Then, after the average track was built, the report stated \"Money spent on track maintenance: 25k.\" This likely means the new track added 15k to my daily expenses. Must double check those expenses. I need a clear budget breakdown to stay on track!\n\n\n**Deconstructing Maintenance Costs**\n\nOkay, the financials are getting murkier. My initial assumption about maintenance costs seems off. It is still unclear if the 25k is for the new average track, the beginner's track, or both. I need to figure out what the costs are to make reliable predictions and optimize spending for the coming days. The 25k maintenance figure is tripping me up, and I suspect the chair lift may have added to it.\n\n\n**Estimating Income and Expenses**\n\nMy income projections look promising. I'm estimating around 58-60k from visitors, based on the previous day's earnings. However, the maintenance costs are still a source of uncertainty. That 25k figure for maintenance feels high, and I'm nervous it might eat into profits. I need to closely monitor the daily financial reports now!\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Income**\n\nI've got a good handle on income projections. Based on yesterday's data, I'm expecting roughly 61k in revenue today. Beginner visitors contribute a solid amount, and the pros add a bit more. However, the exact maintenance costs are still a puzzle, with the 25k figure creating a bit of anxiety. I'm ready to collect today's earnings and start tomorrow strong.\n\n\n"

Given my recent action, Day 2's considerations still hold weight, and I'm recalibrating to factor that in. The user's input is crucial, and I'm sifting through information to determine the most logical path for the user to follow.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Situation Further**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the restaurant constraint, recognizing it's a critical factor. Building more restaurants seems sensible for long-term growth, but immediate actions are necessary to keep popularity up. My current funds and daily profit are healthy, so I can afford to react. Given the time remaining, I have to be smart, and not overextend.\n\n\n**Weighing the Advertising Option**\n\nI'm reconsidering the advertising route. While it offers potential profit gains, the risk of exceeding restaurant capacity looms large. Analyzing the figures, I'm now juggling the cost-benefit ratio of advertising, recognizing that the potential visitor surge could cripple operations. A critical decision: gamble on ads and hope for sufficient funds, or hold back, ensuring a stable but slower growth.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Advertising Question**\n\nI'm now carefully examining the advertising choice. My conclusion is firm: advertising would be too risky right now, and might hasten a negative situation. Building a restaurant is essential, and I must conserve funds to achieve this on Day 3. So, I need to end the day to accrue income and prepare for that critical construction.\n\n\n**Planning the Day's End**\n\nMy analysis confirms the restaurant constraint is critical, with very little wiggle room. I have to prioritize building a restaurant on the next day, since visitor growth is inevitable. Due to insufficient funds, any advertising is off the table, and there's nothing more to build. Ending the day is the sole option, maximizing income to reach the 80k target.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Reflecting on Initial Conditions**\n\nI'm currently reviewing the initial conditions for the \"Ski Resort\" quest, specifically Day 3 with 17 days remaining. My primary focus is on the starting funds, which I've recorded as 105,000 cr. I need to make sure this aligns with the previous turn's calculations. It's crucial to confirm the financial starting point before proceeding further.\n\n\n**Verifying the Discrepancy**\n\nOkay, the discrepancy is becoming clearer. I see the \"Money on the account: 105,000 cr\" and the date still being Day 3. This contradicts the expected balance after building a restaurant and considering the prior day's profit. The \"Money received\" section of the situation confirms a substantial profit, but not enough to explain the 105k from the previous 85k after building a restaurant. Time to scrutinize the action logs again.\n\n\n**Deciphering the Time Paradox**\n\nI'm now wrestling with the temporal inconsistencies. It appears the \"build restaurant\" action occurred instantaneously within the same Day 3. The provided text displays the new restaurant's status and a significantly altered balance. The profit calculation suggests a starting balance far off from my previous tracking. I suspect a misunderstanding of the turn's mechanics.\n\n\n**Interpreting the Game State**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the updated game state. Day 3 continues, and despite my initial confusion, the financials and building statuses seem to align now. The key is to trust the \"CURRENT SITUATION\" as the true reality. I've re-evaluated the profit calculations and current buffers. With the restaurant built, I can now focus on further expansion within the daily build limit, if beneficial.\n\n\n**Reassessing Tactical Options**\n\nDay 3 continues, and the restaurant is built, which is a relief. With 105,000 cr, my focus has shifted to the impending hotel bottleneck. Although I'm 5,000 cr short of the 110k needed for construction, a lift is within budget at 80,000 cr. The situation demands a strategic choice between short-term lift capacity or waiting for funds to expand lodging.\n\n\n**Considering Resource Constraints**\n\nI've determined I can still build another structure on Day 3. With 105,000 cr, the hotel expansion remains out of reach, but a lift is feasible. Given the potential for a hotel bottleneck, I'm weighing the value of a lift against the imminent profit that could secure the hotel build on the next turn. I'll need to decide before Day 3 is over.\n\n\n**Reconciling Temporal Anomalies**\n\nThe financial state is inconsistent, despite having built the restaurant. The balance of 105,000 cr doesn't align with my calculations. I'll need to re-examine the income figures and building expenses to explain this discrepancy. The game state is providing misleading financial data, or I'm missing something crucial in the timeline.\n\n\n**Evaluating Financial Anomalies**\n\nI'm now struggling to reconcile the presented financials. The starting balance doesn't align with my previous spending and expected profits. I'm investigating potential discrepancies in income, expenditures, or perhaps even a misunderstanding of the turn's processing. The text suggests an instant build, though the timeline is unclear.\n\n\n**Deciding the Immediate Build**\n\nI'm now contemplating whether to build a lift or save for the hotel. While the lift's within budget, the hotel's shortage is a bigger concern. Given the potential daily income, I'm leaning toward postponing the lift and prioritizing the hotel build on the next turn. This strategy will allow all arriving guests to stay.\n\n\n**Revising Strategic Priorities**\n\nI've re-examined the financial data and assessed the immediate challenges. The hotel bottleneck is the primary issue. Despite having funds, the hotel's 110k cost remains out of reach today. I am currently 5k short to build the hotel. Therefore, the strategic approach involves prioritizing savings, aiming for the hotel build, and avoiding any actions which may make that impossible.\n\n\n**Calculating Building Capacity**\n\nI'm analyzing the existing and potential visitor numbers to determine if additional construction is necessary on Day 3. I've built the restaurant, leaving me 1 build slot, and my priority is the hotel. I need to make sure I don't build a lift, and keep my money, so I can build the hotel on Day 4. The potential track overflow needs a second look.\n\n\n**Calculating Hotel Requirements**\n\nI'm now focused on the hotel and lift capacity bottlenecks, anticipating the need for additional beds soon. Though the lift is affordable, I must determine if building the beginner track is more strategic. However, 5k short for the hotel. My top priority is building the hotel.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm analyzing the current state with a focus on where the money goes. While my building's operational, I'm trying to figure out which structures will provide the greatest return. I'm especially concerned about the hotel bottleneck. The limited number of beds makes future growth tricky.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hotel Bottleneck**\n\nI'm now contemplating Day 3's final move. With the restaurant built, the hotel's capacity constraints are front of mind. While a lift is affordable, the hotel remains out of reach. Building a lift would potentially delay hotel construction, which is a major concern. The decision now revolves around prioritizing future growth versus immediate improvements.\n\n\n**Analyzing Future Growth Potential**\n\nI'm now contemplating Day 3's ultimate building decision. I must choose between a lift, saving for the hotel, or building another track. However, building the beginner track is the most effective choice. I already built the restaurant, which solved the dining bottleneck. Now I must choose between beginner tracks or nothing.\n\n\n**Anticipating Infrastructure Bottlenecks**\n\nCurrently, I'm analyzing the Day 3 situation, which has me at 105,000 cr after the restaurant build. My analysis indicates a hotel bottleneck and the potential for a beginner track overload on Day 4. I'm focusing on balancing short-term gains (tracks) against my limited building capacity.\n\n\n**Anticipating Infrastructure Bottlenecks**\n\nWith the restaurant built and Day 3 ongoing, the question now revolves around my 105,000 cr balance. While the lift is tempting, the hotel's 110,000 cr cost is more pressing. My analysis suggests that the beginner track, for 30k, offers the best value today, to prepare for more visitors.\n\n\n**Anticipating Strategic Expansion**\n\nNow I have a clearer picture. I'm choosing between a beginner track or saving my funds. The immediate challenge is whether to build another track or save for the hotel build. The beginner track mitigates the track bottleneck, while the hotel maximizes future growth, which means more revenue and improved popularity.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Track Construction**\n\nI'm analyzing the current state and, while the hotel bottleneck is a major concern, I'm leaning toward constructing another beginner track. This decision helps prevent a track overload and maintains popularity, as it's within budget.\n\n\n**Assessing Financial Strategy**\n\nI'm now contemplating the optimal course of action for Day 3. The primary concern is the impending hotel bottleneck. Building the beginner track is tempting, but it would limit my ability to expand tomorrow. Saving my funds to build the hotel and a lift is the best strategy.\n\n\n**Anticipating Strategic Expansion**\n\nI'm now certain I'll be saving my funds. The hotel bottleneck is the immediate challenge, and the limited building capacity makes saving for a double build tomorrow the top priority, for long-term growth. This will allow me to solve both hotel and lift capacity.\n\n\n**Assessing the Ideal Action**\n\nGiven the Day 3 state and the hotel bottleneck, my priority has become saving my funds. Building the beginner track has lost value, so I'll aim to build the hotel and a lift on Day 4 to remove the greatest bottlenecks. This will maximize my future revenue.\n\n\n"

My immediate priority is to examine the current market conditions. The popularity level is the next thing I need to investigate, and then make a decision.\n\n\n**Assessing the Critical Path**\n\nOkay, things are shaping up. I've got a solid financial base, and now it's about making smart investments. The hotel and lifts are the immediate pressure points. The beginner track overflow is costing me, too. I'm going to model a few scenarios, focusing on expanding the hotel and the lifts to maximize growth.\n\n\n**Formulating a High-Level Strategy**\n\nI've examined the core issues and am leaning towards addressing the hard caps first. Option A appears best, although it leaves little room for error. The lifts and hotel are the growth limiters; the track issue is a symptom of existing bottlenecks. I'll need to monitor visitor numbers very closely after building, and I will be looking to make more adjustments.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Build Order**\n\nOkay, I've crunched the numbers again and it's clear: Hotel and Lift are the only viable options for long-term growth, despite the beginner track shortfall. Losing popularity due to track overflow is less damaging than the hard caps on beds and lifts. The beginner track is just a drag on happiness, not a complete halt. I must prioritize. Building those will open the door to exponential revenue.\n\n\n**Evaluating Build Order Options**\n\nThe analysis confirms the hard caps on hotel and lift capacity are paramount. I need to get as many people in as possible, and that means expanding the hotel. Given the daily build limit, the optimal path is a hotel and a lift. The beginner track is an ongoing issue, but not a critical failure condition.\n\n\n**Confirming Optimal Construction**\n\nOkay, so the math is clean. I'm choosing between Hotel + Lift, or, Lift + Hotel. No matter the order, I can build both with existing funds. The beginner track overflow causes a small penalty, but the priority is to break the 60-visitor bottleneck to increase revenue. The decision is made, and I will be building the Hotel and Chair Lift.\n\n\n**Deciding the Order**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the best build order. With limited funds remaining, the sequence is critical. The analysis of my current position and the costs involved point to prioritizing hotel and chair lift construction. The only real trade-off is the initial order. Both strategies work, and a quick implementation is key.\n\n\n"

The daily earnings are solid, but I'm investigating ways to increase that number significantly. I'm especially interested in figuring out how to optimize my trade routes, and identify more efficient cargo transportation.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Budget**\n\nMy finances are looking much better, with a solid daily net profit of around 140,000 cr. However, the ski lifts are overloaded. I have a critical capacity issue there, which is costing me in popularity, though the new hotel is offsetting this. With 82,000 credits, I'm considering building a lift, which costs 80,000.\n\n\n**Addressing Capacity Constraints**\n\nRight now, the priority is clear: the ski lift bottleneck. With only 2,000 credits remaining after the hotel construction, I'm opting to construct a new chair lift. This will boost lift capacity to 90, resolving the immediate problem of visitor congestion. The track upgrades will have to wait for now.\n\n\n**Assessing Construction Priorities**\n\nThe immediate focus has shifted to the ski lift bottleneck; 10 unsatisfied visitors are a concern. Building a ski lift now seems the most effective course of action, which consumes my final build action for the day, leaving me with a small financial cushion. This resolves the lift issue, while the track overloads will have to wait for now.\n\n\n**Confirming the Build Sequence**\n\nWith the hotel constructed, the next priority is definitely the ski lift. Despite the tight budget of 82,000 cr remaining after building the hotel, the lift is crucial. Building it now will resolve the visitor congestion, which will become a bigger issue than the overloaded tracks. Building the lift leaves only 2,000 cr, but the income should be enough to cover the next day.\n\n\n"

It's a tricky situation that warrants careful consideration.\n\n\n**Assessing Bottlenecks and Strategies**\n\nI am now focusing on resolving the critical bottleneck: the ski lifts.

Building a restaurant would be counter productive with the current lift bottleneck, so it's not a sensible option.\n\n\n**Planning the Construction Phase**\n\nI am now fully committed to the construction of a chair lift. The analysis reveals the lift as the critical bottleneck, and despite the tight budget constraints, it is the most crucial investment. My thoughts have also considered the potential risk associated with the low remaining credit balance, but the potential revenue increase from improved visitor satisfaction justifies the decision.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Strategy**\n\nAfter weighing the options, my decision is clear: building the chair lift is essential. Despite the financial risk of leaving a mere 2,000 credits, the lift addresses the critical capacity bottleneck. I'm betting on revenue from the additional satisfaction from visitors, and believe that the boost in visitor happiness and spending is the best course of action. I will build the lift.\n\n\n"

The next potential bottleneck is the restaurant (17 spare seats), but that isn't urgent today as I have enough capacity for current visitors plus some growth.\n\nI have not started advertising yet. My popularity is mediocre (47%). Now that I have significant excess capacity in all areas (Hotels +47 spots, Tracks +7 spots, Lifts +17 spots, Restaurants +17 spots), I can finally afford to start turning on the marketing machine. However, I cannot adjust advertising settings from the main menu; I usually have to talk to the advertising manager or wait for a prompt.\n\nSince I cannot adjust advertising here (it's not an option in the top-level list, usually done via \"Talk to experts\" -> \"Ad manager\" or a specific choice if available, but \"Build something\" is the active choice for spending capital on structure), and I don't need to build anything else urgently today (saving money for the next big jump is wise), I should check if I can start advertising. Wait, looking at previous steps, the option to spend on ads appeared under \"Talk to experts\" -> \"Advertising manager\" or just as a menu option if the game flow allows. Actually, looking back at step 7, the ad manager lets you set the daily spend.\n\nHowever, right now, I have cleared the bottlenecks. I have 106k. Building another restaurant (80k) now would be proactive but leaves me with 26k. If I don't build, I end the day with 106k + revenue (~130k net) = ~236k. That puts me in range of massive upgrades (Hotel + Cabin Lift).\n\nLet's look at the growth. 73 visitors. If I grow by ~15-20, I hit the restaurant cap (90).\nIf I end the day now, I bank the money.\nIs there anything critical to build? A restaurant (80k) would secure the next growth phase.

I am on track, but I need to maintain growth.\nIf I rest now, I risk hitting the restaurant cap tomorrow if growth is good.\nIf I build a restaurant now (80k), I have 26k left.\nActually, if I start advertising, I fill up faster.\nLet's try to turn on advertising to boost that 47% popularity.

      "thinking_tokens": "**Evaluating Current Options**\n\nOkay, I've assessed the situation: Day 5, 106,000 credits, and 73 visitors. The user wants me to make a choice. I'm focusing on the best use of my resources, considering both the timeline and the visitor count. Right now, I'm leaning toward a decision that will increase revenue, and secure more visitors. The question of how much it'll cost vs benefit, remains.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crucial decision of where to allocate resources. Expanding the beginner track is an urgent matter. The risk of losing visitors due to overcrowding is too high to ignore. I'm weighing the costs of construction against the benefits of increased visitor satisfaction and potential revenue growth. Focusing on immediate gains, and then considering advertising later is essential for long-term success.\n\n\n**Identifying the Critical Path**\n\nI'm now completely focused on the beginner track's capacity. The analysis confirms a serious bottleneck. Advertising is out of the question until I alleviate overcrowding. I'm reviewing the recent build decision; specifically, how the Average Track was funded on day 5. The key is to manage the beginner influx, and that demands immediate attention to avoid any negative impact. I should look into building an extra beginner track.\n\n\n**Formulating the Next Move**\n\nOkay, I've just analyzed the situation, and I'm at the end of Day 5, with the capacity of beginner tracks nearing breaking point. Building another beginner track is an immediate necessity. This will also give me the opportunity to explore advertisement and, ultimately, increase revenue, which is vital. Should I build another restaurant? It's too expensive right now, and the beginner track is far more urgent.\n\n\n**Formulating a Building Strategy**\n\nAlright, I'm now in the \"Talk to experts\" menu and must decide. The primary focus is the beginner track capacity. It's almost full, and advertising is out until it's addressed. Fortunately, the \"Build something\" option is available! I need to build a beginner track immediately (30k) to prevent overcrowding. I should then consider advertising, and a restaurant build for the next bottleneck.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan of Action**\n\nOkay, I'm now in the \"Talk to experts\" menu. I've re-evaluated my options, prioritizing the immediate need to expand the beginner track. I have one build action left, and I must build a beginner track to avoid overcrowding. The advertisement manager is there, and I can talk to them, but I need to build before advertising. Then, I will address the restaurant or lift bottlenecks.\n\n\n**Planning Immediate Actions**\n\nMy current plan involves a careful assessment of the immediate requirements. Building an additional beginner track is the top priority, considering the current capacity issues. This approach is the most efficient, and will prepare for advertising. My decision to focus on the beginner track is strategic, ensuring the avoidance of any penalty.\n\n\n**Deciding the Immediate Build**\n\nI've re-examined the numbers, and the critical issue is beginner track capacity. It's almost at breaking point with 59 visitors and a capacity of only 60. Advertising is a bad idea right now, as it would cause an immediate penalty. My next move *must* be building a beginner track (30k). The game allows this action directly.\n\n\n"

The choice is crucial to accommodate future visitors.\n\n\n**Considering Track Expansion Needs**\n\nI'm focused on the beginner track capacity. Right now, it's dangerously close to maxing out, and I see more beginners coming. With 59 beginners currently, and only a capacity of 60, I need a solution, and fast. The restaurants and lifts are okay for now, and I have enough money. The only option is to build another beginner track.\n\n\n**Evaluating Best Course**\n\nMy analysis revealed a critical need to increase beginner track capacity immediately. Options include a dedicated Beginner Track or a combined Average Track. However, the budget is a key factor. Considering future earnings, I'm leaning toward the cheaper, immediate solution to avoid negative popularity impacts.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Recommendation**\n\nI'm now completely settled on the Beginner Track build. My analysis has repeatedly emphasized the urgent need to expand beginner capacity, and this option provides the most immediate solution for the least amount of funds. I've also re-evaluated the Average Track option to conclude the Beginner Track's higher capacity is simply the safest choice, considering a potential surge in beginner arrivals. Building this track should also set me up well for the near future, considering restaurant and chair lift capacities.\n\n\n**Concluding Track Choice**\n\nI've meticulously reviewed the data, running the numbers again. The Beginner Track is the clear winner, addressing the immediate risk. Though the average track seems tempting, I've decided to prioritize beginner capacity given the current visitor influx. The budget is sound, and I'll still have ample funds after the build for future restaurant or chair lift expansion.\n\n\n"

I see the user is asking me to make a choice, and I need to assess the context to make an informed recommendation. I've noted the current financial standing and time constraints.\n\n\n**Considering Strategic Options**\n\nI've reviewed the current state of the game, observing solid financials and excess capacity. Advertising seems the obvious path, with ample room in hotels, lifts, restaurants, and tracks for more visitors. The question now is whether to talk to experts (Start Advertising) or take a break.\n\n\n**Weighing the Decision**\n\nI'm analyzing the pros and cons of my options. Advertising seems like the logical next step, but I'm cautious about exceeding restaurant and lift capacities. Natural growth is slow. Do I advertise now, or wait and build? I'm weighing the risk of over-capacity versus slow organic growth. I'm leaning toward a modest advertising strategy.\n\n\n**Choosing a Course of Action**\n\nI've considered the options, analyzing the pros and cons of both. Advertising seems beneficial for growth, but I'm wary of exceeding restaurant and lift capacities. Natural visitor growth is modest. I'm leaning toward a balanced approach: talk to experts and cautiously advertise.\n\n\n**Determining Optimal Actions**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the optimal action, given the information. The previous option was \"build\", but I've hit the construction limit. Now, it's advertising or rest. Advertising is key to fighting the daily popularity decay. I will talk to the experts to start advertising.\n\n\n**Determining Marketing Strategy**\n\nI'm now certain I'll talk to the experts, as the only logical move. Natural popularity decay necessitates advertising. Capacity exists. Filling the open hotels and lifts is the key to profit now that bottlenecks are fixed. The next step is the Ad Manager, and I have funds ready.\n\n\n"

The figures are crucial: spending 10,000 cr nets a 3-5% boost to popularity, while natural decay eats away at 5-10% daily. To keep those beds filled, I must spend money to make money.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nThe analysis confirms plenty of spare capacity. Given the need for more visitors, the math is now clear.

My main focus is now on balancing growth with immediate investment to increase capacity, and I have a clear path to generating more revenue.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Best Strategy**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the optimal advertising spend.

This should ensure the hotel beds fill up, and it's within the safe limits for my infrastructure. I'm ready to move forward.\n\n\n"

My restaurants, ski lifts, and pro tracks are dangerously close to maxing out. Fortunately, I have nearly 200,000 credits to address the problem. Level 2 infrastructure caps are the current issue. I need to make some immediate expansion decisions to avoid losing visitors and popularity.

Option B - Cabin Lift and Restaurant - is the play. It maximizes lift capacity for a reasonable price, providing the best future-proofing. This setup leaves me with 8,000 credits, but this should be enough to stay afloat until my revenue improves.

The situation is constantly evolving, and I need to adapt my approach based on visitors' actions, but right now the visitor data is not populated, so I need to check the relevant variables to get things moving.\n\n\n**Assessing Immediate Priorities**\n\nI've got the data, and it's clear: lifts and restaurants are the primary concerns with such slim margins. Pros are a secondary concern given the visitor mix. Given the 198,000 credits, my strategy involves constructing a new lift and restaurant, which will cost 160,000, and leave me with 38,000 remaining.\n\n\n**Finalizing Construction Plans**\n\nBuilding both a new lift and a new restaurant is critical, so the question is, which lift? The cabin lift provides the best long-term capacity at 140, costing 110k, while the restaurant costs 80k. With a budget of 198k, this leaves us with 8k. Building both these structures allows for future growth.\n\n\n**Planning Constructions Further**\n\nI've made the decision to build the Cabin Lift and a new Restaurant, as they are crucial, and have sufficient funds. Given the cost of each building, this strategy will alleviate the immediate pressure on those areas. The pro track bottleneck is less severe. The next step is to initiate construction. I must begin with the Ski Lift.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Execution Plan**\n\nI've reviewed the current situation once again, re-evaluating priorities. The plan remains the same: I'll initiate the construction of the Ski Lift with Cabins first, then the restaurant. This approach addresses the most pressing bottlenecks: lifts and restaurants, offering the greatest capacity increase with the available funds, and ensuring continued growth.\n\n\n"

The clock is ticking, and there are 13 days remaining.\n\n\n**Considering Construction Options**\n\nI've narrowed the focus to building options.

I am also thinking about the average track, as it would create some buffer for both beginners and pros.\n\n\n**Choosing a Building**\n\nI've decided.

I'm also watching the hotel capacity closely.\n\n\n**Choosing Build Priorities**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the data and concluded that the Pro track capacity is the immediate and most pressing issue, and the best decision is to build a Pro track. The average track seems too risky. Afterwards, I will construct a new hotel to keep up with guest demand. I can afford both, so that's what I'll do.\n\n\n**Evaluating Bottlenecks and Actions**\n\nI've decided to prioritize.

The 100 visitors suggest a need to invest. I'm focusing on balancing short-term gains with long-term growth.\n\n\n**Planning Track Improvements**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on immediate needs. The pro track overcrowding is a major issue, so that's the absolute priority. I have to decide how best to address the critical lack of space for the professionals, given the available budget and time constraints. Expanding beginner capacity is also starting to look essential.\n\n\n**Calculating Build Costs**\n\nI'm now weighing the costs and benefits of each track option. Building a Pro Track for 60k is the cleanest solution for the pro overcrowding. I can probably construct two structures per turn, leaving me with enough to expand hotels. Two Average Tracks would cost 90k, create more beginner space, but only just fix the pro overcrowding.\n\n\n**Determining Optimal Builds**\n\nNow, I've honed in on the optimal two-build strategy. The immediate concern is the pro track bottleneck, coupled with the need for hotel expansion. Plan A, building a Pro Track and a Hotel, seems the safest bet. It gives room for Pro growth and delays hitting the hotel limit. The biggest worry is beginner capacity.\n\n\n**Evaluating Hotel Capacity**\n\nI've determined the priority is to fix the overcrowded Pro Track, and then the Hotel. The most pressing issue is the pro deficit. After that, expanding the hotels is critical. I'm choosing between a Pro Track plus a Hotel, or an Average Track plus a Hotel. The Pro Track creates room for the Pros, but the Beginner capacity is tight. However, hotels must be expanded to maintain growth.\n\n\n**Analyzing Build Combinations**\n\nI'm now running the calculations. I've broken down the possibilities for the two builds allowed. Solving the pro overcrowding is essential, with the hotel's capacity as the second concern. The question remains: Pro Track with Hotel, or Average Track with Hotel? I'm evaluating the risks for tomorrow.\n\n\n**Evaluating Priorities and Risks**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most critical fixes. With the pro track over capacity, and hotel space dwindling, my immediate focus is on decisive solutions. Building a Pro Track first seems essential, but I still have to weigh whether I should build a hotel or an average track in order to accommodate my long-term strategy. The beginner capacity remains a concern.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Best Path**\n\nI'm now prioritizing the most critical construction. Fixing the pro track overcrowding is paramount, so the track is the first build. It's a choice between an Average Track or a Pro Track. Then, I have to decide if a Hotel is the next priority.\n\n\n**Determining Immediate Actions**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The current state demands I build a Pro Track, given the overcrowding. The second build must address hotel capacity, or the lack thereof, as growth is at risk. The potential of beginner track overflow must be carefully considered, but the immediate crisis is clear.\n\n\n"

I've got 210,000 credits now, and I'm aiming for a million! My ski resort has 100 visitors, a mix of beginners and experienced folks.\n\n\n**Assessing Infrastructure Needs**\n\nThe analysis continues, with a focus on resource allocation. I see that the hotels are becoming a critical constraint. My initial projections confirm the need for an additional hotel to avoid hitting capacity. The existing buffer is shrinking, and I can't afford to slow the influx of visitors. With 210,000 credits, the hotel build is a priority.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Build**\n\nOkay, I've re-evaluated the build order. The beginner track bottleneck appears to be the more immediate threat. If I build the hotel, I get more capacity for revenue, but it's not a *guarantee*. If the beginner tracks cap, I immediately lose popularity and profit. It's a tough call. I'm going to lean towards building a beginner track, since overcrowding *hurts the revenue I already have*, and then plan to build another hotel the next day.\n\n\n**Refining the Strategy**\n\nThe analysis confirms the need for a Hotel and a Beginner Track. Given the one build per turn constraint, the Beginner Track is the priority because its buffer will hit first. It's a race against the clock to avoid a popularity drop. The hotel, with its larger capacity, will have to wait for now. Building the track will ensure I don't lose revenue I'm already getting.\n\n\n**Evaluating Build Choices**\n\nI'm now weighing the immediate threats to my revenue stream. My top priority is to avoid hitting the hotel capacity. This caps my potential earnings, hindering my push to 1M credits. However, overcrowding on the beginner tracks could quickly erode my existing income, so I'm also considering building the average track. It's a tough decision, but building the hotel first seems to offer the most potential.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Build Decision**\n\nI've re-analyzed the situation again, and the beginner track bottleneck is the more pressing issue. The hotel's capacity has a bit more time. Building an average track does not solve the overall problem and spends more money than building the Beginner Track. So the beginner track is the right play now. I can build the hotel tomorrow.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Growth**\n\nMy analysis has refined my decision-making process. I'm focusing on the hotel capacity as the hard constraint, given my goal of maximizing revenue, but I recognize that overcrowding on the beginner tracks could quickly erode my income. The beginner track buffer is more likely to hit tomorrow. Since I can build two things tomorrow, building the hotel can be put off until then.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Immediate Bottleneck**\n\nI am now focusing on the immediate impact of my build choices. The primary constraint is my hotel capacity. Even though I have 20 free beds, my beginner tracks' capacity is tighter. Since I can build two things tomorrow, building the track will avoid lost revenue.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Needs**\n\nI'm focused on the most critical need: hotel capacity. With my 1M credit goal, the flow of income is key, and the potential for losing revenue by being capped by the hotel concerns me. The beginner track is a short-term issue that will still not hinder income flow in the same way. Therefore, the hotel is the answer today.\n\n\n**Focusing on Hotel Expansion**\n\nI've re-examined the numbers, and the hotel capacity is still the critical factor. Building the hotel first ensures maximum revenue and supports the 1M credit goal. I'm focusing on revenue growth, and the hotel is the bottleneck. The beginner track issue is important, but preventing a revenue slowdown by being capped is more important.\n\n\n"

I will likely hit the 120-bed limit tomorrow.\n\nIf I reach the hotel cap, I cannot accept new guests, which halts my revenue growth completely. While I also have a tight buffer on beginner tracks (73 visitors vs 80 spots), a track shortage only causes a minor popularity penalty, whereas a hotel shortage causes lost customers and lost revenue. Maximizing accommodation capacity is the most important step to reaching the 1,000,000 cr goal. I have 210,000 cr, so I can easily afford the 110,000 cr investment while leaving a healthy safety margin.",

I've noted the current visitor count is 100, well within the hotel's capacity of 120 and the restaurant's 135. The buffers, 20 and 35 respectively, give me some breathing room.\n\n\n**Assess Visitor Growth Projections**\n\nI've re-examined the expected visitor increase. Considering yesterday's +17, and with advertising active and popularity high, +18 or +19 tomorrow seems likely. This means I'll exceed the hotel capacity. The beginner track also looks like it will be overrun if I do nothing.\n\n\n**Considering Strategic Options**\n\nOkay, so I have a single build slot left. The hotel, with its buffer nearly gone, screams for attention, while the beginner track is likely to be overrun. Building a new hotel costs a lot and doesn't fix the beginner track's impending overflow. Conversely, a beginner track build helps immediately. Maybe a balance is needed; both are important, but funds are tight. I'm torn between securing future revenue or addressing the immediate bottleneck. I'll need to account for costs and the rate of visitor growth.\n\n\n**Analyzing Available Resources**\n\nI've carefully assessed the situation, considering all facilities and visitor numbers, focusing on tomorrow's projections. A surge in visitors is likely, potentially filling the hotel capacity. The beginner track is nearing its limit, and a decision must be made with the remaining build slot. I have a choice between constructing a hotel, a beginner track, or an average track, which poses a difficult choice. My primary concern centers on maximizing revenue and maintaining a good popular score.\n\n\n**Evaluating The Best Option**\n\nI've carefully considered the potential gains and losses. Building the hotel first ensures the capacity I already have isn't wasted. While the beginner track shortage is a concern, it's less impactful than a complete lack of available beds. Therefore, I will prioritize building the hotel, even though it reduces my cash on hand. I need to make the hotel an 180 capacity hotel.\n\n\n**Confirming the Best Strategy**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The numbers don't lie. Even if my projected visitor increase is smaller than anticipated, the risk of a hard revenue cap by the hotel outweighs all other concerns. Building the hotel first allows the lift and restaurant upgrades to operate at full capacity. The hotel is also financially achievable without putting me in a dangerous cash position.\n\n\n"

I've amassed a substantial fortune of 308,000 credits, and my popularity is soaring at 74% due to effective advertising and facility management. I have 130 visitors currently.\n\n\n**Addressing Critical Issues Immediately**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy current priorities are clear: alleviate overcrowding on beginner tracks, expand restaurant capacity, and increase ski lift availability. The deficit on beginner tracks is actively penalizing my popularity. Restaurants and lifts are dangerously close to capacity, threatening to bottleneck. Considering I can build two structures daily and have ample funds, I'm focusing on immediate solutions, specifically upgrading these bottlenecks. I'll need to monitor the impact closely.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis reveals three critical bottlenecks: beginner tracks, restaurants, and ski lifts. I'm facing an active penalty from the crowded beginner tracks. The restaurant and lifts are nearly at capacity, threatening significant losses. Considering available funds and daily building limits, I'm weighing immediate solutions. I can build two structures daily. Should I prioritize alleviating the current beginner track shortage or pre-emptively expanding restaurant and lift capacity?\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis indicates significant capacity issues across restaurants, lifts, and beginner tracks. With funds readily available, I'm weighing immediate actions. Building two structures daily necessitates prioritizing. The existing beginner track deficit is actively penalizing my popularity. Conversely, impending restaurant and lift bottlenecks threaten significant future losses. Given visitor growth, I'm leaning toward addressing the more critical infrastructure bottlenecks first: prioritizing restaurants and ski lifts. This maximizes overall capacity and mitigates potential revenue losses.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Management**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis reveals a stark reality: I'm facing three critical capacity issues: restaurants, ski lifts, and beginner tracks. With funds in ample supply and building constraints in place, I must strategically prioritize. The existing track deficit is actively impacting popularity, whereas impending restaurant and lift bottlenecks threaten imminent revenue loss. Therefore, my course of action is building a Cabin Lift (110k) and then a Restaurant (80k), to maximize revenue.\n\n\n**Refining Strategic Execution**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis of the \"Ski Resort\" quest reveals an urgent need to address critical bottlenecks, particularly in restaurants and ski lifts. While the overcrowded beginner tracks present an immediate popularity penalty, the impending capacity limits in restaurants and lifts threaten significant revenue loss and reduced popularity. After reviewing all data, building a Restaurant and a Beginner Track is the optimal strategy, despite some capacity issues with the ski lifts.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Maximization**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis reveals crucial capacity constraints across restaurants, ski lifts, and beginner tracks. With plentiful funds and building constraints, strategic prioritization is essential. Given the immediate beginner track deficit and the impending restaurant and lift bottlenecks, my focus is clear: building a Restaurant and a Beginner Track to balance immediate needs against long-term growth.\n\n\n**Reassessing Tactical Options**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis of the situation continues. I've re-evaluated building strategies, considering the urgent capacity issues.  While beginner tracks need attention, addressing restaurant and ski lift limitations is paramount. Restaurant and lift capacity are severely strained. Although the track deficit causes a penalty, the inability to accommodate new visitors is worse.  My focus is now Restaurant then Cabin Lift.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Needs**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis shows that I'm facing a combination of active penalties and imminent capacity bottlenecks, specifically with beginner tracks, restaurants, and ski lifts. Restaurants have a tiny buffer, and lifts are closely behind. I'll prioritize a Restaurant and an Average Track to address short-term problems.\n\n\n"

I need to figure out the best way to utilize the current funds to maximize profit and ensure we succeed in this ski resort game. Are there any opportunities to upgrade or expand?\n\n\n**Assessing Critical Bottlenecks**\n\nI'm zeroing in on the infrastructure issues. The ski lifts and beginner tracks are screaming for attention. The data shows a clear deficit in capacity for both, threatening the resort's growth. I need to prioritize solutions to avoid losing visitors, as this situation may not last for long!\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\nI'm now focusing on optimizing the use of the remaining construction slot. The primary concern is the ski lift capacity, which is nearly maxed out. While the beginner tracks are also strained, preventing visitor loss due to lift capacity seems like the most urgent decision. The budget is healthy, so upgrading the lifts is the top priority.\n\n\n**Deciding Resort Upgrades**\n\nI've reviewed the current situation: the lifts are strained with minimal buffer. Beginner tracks are already over capacity, and I expect continued visitor growth. With plenty of funds available, I've narrowed down the options. The Cabin Lift seems most vital for preventing guest loss due to its high impact on capacity.\n\n\n**Determining Immediate Actions**\n\nThe analysis is complete, and the next step is crystal clear. With a high budget and severe lift limitations, building the Cabin Lift is the only rational choice. It eliminates the risk of significant visitor loss, allowing me to focus on track upgrades. The goal is to select the cabin lift build option immediately.\n\n\n**Evaluating Immediate Infrastructure Needs**\n\nI'm deep in the analysis, and the data is screaming for attention! My lifts are at a critical 10-person buffer, while beginner tracks are already overcrowded. Given the high growth rate, I must expand lift capacity to prevent significant guest loss, before I can focus on tracks. The restaurant is already built, so the lift must be the priority.\n\n\n**Analyzing Immediate Requirements**\n\nI'm now calculating the projected impact of guest growth against my existing infrastructure. The ski lifts are teetering on the edge, while the beginner tracks are already suffering overcrowding. Because of the limited build slots, and high potential guest increases, I must ensure lifts are built first to capture revenue. My decision now is clear; build the cabin lift.\n\n\n**Determining Next Infrastructure Choice**\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the current situation, and it's clear the lifts need immediate attention, but I am able to build twice. My current priorities are aligned; the lift capacity is severely limited and must be addressed. The beginner tracks are also showing critical issues. So I will build the cabin lift, and then I will address the beginner tracks.\n\n\n"

Building a Cabin Lift is the clear winner, with the projected visitor increase. Given the track's overcrowding, I am choosing to prioritize the lift. This will prevent a bottleneck on the slopes. I am confident in my choice to maximize visitor enjoyment and, consequently, boost revenue. I can address the beginner track capacity issues later.\n\n\n**Confirming Strategic Focus**\n\nOkay, my analysis is now complete.

Seems I need to find a lucrative opportunity, and fast. The game wants me to make a crucial choice; I need to weigh the risks. What are the best avenues to maximize profits with minimal downside? I'll need to consider what options are available on this turn, and which ones will generate the highest return on investment.\n\n\n**Analyzing My Priorities**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nToday I'm honing in on the most pressing issues. The initial assessment confirmed my suspicions; track capacity is the immediate constraint. Beginner tracks are slightly overbooked, but pro tracks are the real problem, bleeding popularity. I've got two construction slots available today; the optimal strategy seems clear. I'm prioritizing track expansion to mitigate the negative impact on popularity, and the pros are hitting me the hardest, so that's where I'll put my focus first.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Allocation**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy construction strategy is taking shape. Given my current budget, I'm leaning toward an \"Average track\" at 45k, which provides a balanced capacity increase for both beginners and pros. This would give me a buffer in both tracks and help my popularity issues. Focusing solely on pros with a dedicated track is tempting, but the balanced approach seems more efficient for short-term gains, despite the slight cost benefit of the Pro track. My main goal is to improve popularity fast.\n\n\n**Evaluating Track Expansion Plans**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nToday I'm refining my construction approach. Given the high budget, I'm ditching the average tracks and moving toward specialized solutions. The initial step is to build a Pro track, alleviating the larger popularity penalty from the pro track deficit. I'll need to observe the results. After that, I will immediately construct a beginner track in order to provide the greatest buffer and guarantee I won't have to worry about tracks for several turns.\n\n\n**Planning Construction Strategy**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy analysis has led me to a definitive construction plan. I'll begin by building a \"Track for Pros,\" which should be enough to eliminate the higher penalties for overcrowding the Pro tracks. Next, I'll build a \"Track for Beginners,\" to fully alleviate the visitor deficit. I have plenty of funds, so there is no room for mistakes. This focused approach provides a substantial capacity increase, and sets the stage for rapid expansion. I'll begin executing my strategy today.\n\n\n**Implementing the Plan**\n\n\\n\\n\n\nMy construction strategy is now finalized, so I'm moving forward with execution. With my ample funds, the optimal solution is a two-step approach. First, I will build the \"Track for Pros\" to address the immediate popularity loss from overcrowding. Second, I will build a \"Track for Beginners\" to increase the buffer and avoid track issues in the near future. This ensures maximum capacity and positive sentiment.\n\n\n"

Step 80 has me carefully examining the calendar, noting the date and time constraints within the simulation's mechanics. The pressure is on to make the most optimal decision with the limited resources.\n\n\n**Calculating Infrastructure Needs**\n\nI've got it. Based on the financial and capacity data, I must build beginner tracks immediately. Pro tracks are fine for now. The beginner tracks are the biggest constraint, and failure to act will be the end of the game! The financial projections are encouraging.\n\n\n**Deciding on Immediate Actions**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The game is basically won, provided I avoid any critical mistakes. Building new infrastructure *now* is a waste. The risk is manageable; a sudden dip in popularity is the only real threat. I'm choosing to do nothing, trusting the current projections to secure victory on the next turn.\n\n\n**Deciding on Investments**\n\nI'm deep in the final analysis, focused on minimizing risk. Given the close proximity to the win condition, and the narrow buffer in beginner tracks, I've decided it is prudent to invest 30,000 cr in one \"Track for beginners\" to avoid an overcrowding penalty. This strategy maximizes revenue, and guarantees me victory. The remaining assets, like Hotels, and Lifts are stable, and will not be invested in.\n\n\n**Formulating Action Steps**\n\nMy strategy is now solidified, including infrastructure investment to maintain profit. My next step is to initiate the build process for a \"Track for beginners,\" spending 30,000 cr to shore up the capacity issues. I've re-examined the financials, and building now guarantees a smooth transition and ensures I am still winning.\n\n\n**Confirming Optimal Actions**\n\nMy analysis is complete. Although the win condition is nearly secured, I've re-evaluated and decided to invest in one \"Track for beginners\" at a cost of 30,000 cr. It's the only way to safeguard the win. The revenue projections are steady, so this minimizes the risk of a late-game misstep.\n\n\n**Evaluating Final Actions**\n\nI've re-examined the game state, and after careful deliberation, I'm confident the optimal play is to invest in a \"Track for beginners.\" This is primarily to avoid overcrowding penalties that could potentially impact my revenue on the final day, given the very tight capacity of the beginner tracks. This strategic investment provides the greatest assurance of a smooth victory.\n\n\n"

My current cash reserves are at 746,000 cr., and the goal is 1,000,000 cr. I need to consider the daily income from beginners and pros. This will inform the optimal decision to reach the monetary target, taking into account time and potential risk.\n\n\n**Considering Future Scenarios**\n\nI'm now projecting what will happen tomorrow. The analysis shows that overcrowding the beginner tracks is inevitable if I end the day without action. However, based on the rules, the financial impact of that penalty is not immediate. Despite the risk of reduced popularity, I am on the verge of victory. I am now weighing the pros and cons of ending the day to reach the money target tomorrow.\n\n\n**Deciding on Final Move**\n\nAnalyzing the strategic options, I've discarded building hotels or lifts due to the financial impact and the low probability of failing to meet the monetary goals. Building a beginner track seems viable to mitigate overcrowding. I am now leaning towards building the beginner track to minimize any loss of popularity and to ensure continued high income tomorrow morning. This protects the win condition.\n\n\n**Evaluating Optimal Action Again**\n\nMy focus is now on the optimal build choice. Weighing the options again, I've confirmed that the beginner track remains the best, safest choice, despite the small financial impact. The analysis reveals the critical need to preserve customer satisfaction, even with the looming victory. It's a calculated decision, ensuring a smooth path to the monetary goal.\n\n\n**Refining the Decision Again**\n\nI've re-examined the financial margin and considered the growth figures. While both options lead to a win, building nothing seems safer to win outright. But, I am worried the penalty for the beginner track will happen before income. I will have to pick between guaranteed victory, or a reduced chance of victory, combined with good park design. Ultimately, I will opt to build, as it prevents overcrowding and maintains a stable income, prioritizing park management.\n\n\n**Confirming the Winning Strategy**\n\nI've re-examined the potential outcome with and without building. My analysis confirms that building the beginner track offers the best balance of safety and park management. The financial impact is minimal compared to the projected income, and it avoids the overcrowding penalty. I'm now fully committed to the beginner track build for a stable victory.\n\n\n"
