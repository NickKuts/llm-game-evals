This resulted in 6 disappointed beginners, which contributed to our popularity dropping from 50% to 45%. Furthermore, with 71 total visitors, we are approaching our restaurant limit (90 seats) and our beginner track limit must be resolved immediately to prevent further popularity loss.\n\nStrategic plan for today with 103,000 cr:\n1. **Resolve Beginner Track Bottleneck:** I will build an Average Track (45,000 cr). This adds +10 beginner capacity and +10 pro capacity. Total capacity will become 60 beginners and 60 pros. This covers our current 56 beginners and offers growth for pros.\n2. **Handle Growing Population:** After building the track, I will have 58,000 cr. Tonight's revenue from 71 guests (56 beginners x 2k + 15 pros x 6k = 112k + 90k) will be 202,000 cr. This massive income will easily cover tonight's ~85k expenses. \n3. **Advertising:** Since popularity is slipping and our capacity is expanding, it's time to increase advertising to 20,000 or 30,000 cr to draw in more high-paying pros, but first I must build the track to avoid penalties.\n\nI will build the average track first.",

First, beginner track capacity is at 90, but there are 99 beginners currently at the resort. This means 9 beginners are unserved, causing immediate guest disappointment. Second, the total number of visitors (135) has exactly reached the total restaurant capacity (135). Given the current growth rate (23 new arrivals yesterday), the restaurant capacity will be exceeded tonight if no action is taken.\n\nWith 345,000 cr, I have ample funds to solve both issues today using our two-construction-per-day limit. Buying an \"Average track\" for 45,000 cr is the most efficient choice for the first slot. It increases beginner capacity to 100 and pro capacity to 100. This resolves the current shortage for the 99 beginners and provides extra room for high-paying professionals. This move also provides a popularity boost. After this, I will use my second build slot today to build a fourth restaurant (80,000 cr) to raise that capacity to 180, aligning it with my hotel capacity for future growth.\n\nACTION: 4",
      "reasoning": "The resort has encountered two simultaneous bottlenecks that are slowing down growth and hurting popularity. First, beginner track capacity is at 90, but there are 99 beginners currently at the resort. This means 9 beginners are unserved, causing immediate guest disappointment. Second, the total number of visitors (135) has exactly reached the total restaurant capacity (135). Given the current growth rate (23 new arrivals yesterday), the restaurant capacity will be exceeded tonight if no action is taken.\n\nWith 345,000 cr, I have ample funds to solve both issues today using our two-construction-per-day limit.

Additionally, with 162 total visitors and a growth of 22 new arrivals yesterday, we are guaranteed to exceed our hotel and restaurant limits (180) tomorrow.\n\nStrategic plan for today:\n1. **Fix Active Bottleneck:** Build an Average Track (45,000 cr). This raises beginner capacity to 120 and pro capacity to 120, satisfying our current 117 beginners and 45 pros.\n2. **Expand Scaling Limits:** Build a fourth Hotel (110,000 cr) to raise the guest ceiling to 240.\n3. **Pivoting for the Goal:** With only 7 days left, I need to reach 1,000,000 cr.
