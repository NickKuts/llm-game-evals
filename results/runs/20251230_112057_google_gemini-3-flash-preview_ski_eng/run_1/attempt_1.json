This means 8 beginners and 4 pros are currently disappointed, which will trigger a popularity penalty (1% per beginner, 2% per pro). An Average track costs 45,000 cr and accommodates 10 beginners and 10 pros. This is the most efficient choice because it immediately solves the shortage for both types of visitors: it will cover the 8 extra beginners (with 2 slots left for growth) and the 4 pros (with 6 slots left for growth). Building this will stop the reputation damage and contribute to the popularity boost from new construction. I will still have 65,000 cr left, allowing me to save for a lift or further expansion tomorrow.",

With current growth (+16 net new visitors yesterday), we will exceed 90 people tomorrow.\n2. **Track Bottleneck**: We have 61 beginners against 70 slots and 20 pros against 30 slots. Similar to the restaurants, we will hit these limits within 1-2 days.\n3. **Hotel Bottleneck**: We have 81 visitors in a 120-bed resort. To reach the 1,000,000 cr goal, we need to keep expanding our bed count once current hotels are near full.\n\nI have 148,000 cr. Since I can build up to two structures per day, I should prioritize the infrastructure that will fail first. A third **Restaurant** (80,000 cr) is essential today because even a small overflow of guests without seats will penalize the popularity we worked so hard to recover. Building a restaurant now adds 45 seats (total 135), ensuring we can fully support the current hotels (120 beds) and even the next expansion. After building a restaurant, I will have 68,000 cr, which I can use to build a **Track for beginners** (30,000 cr) or save for a hotel tomorrow. I will start by building the restaurant.",
