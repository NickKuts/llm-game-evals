  "failure_reflection": "**REFLECTION:**\n\n1. **Strategic Mistakes:** The primary failure was excessive infrastructure scaling too early. Building the second set of tracks (Pro and Beginner) and the second ski lift created a massive fixed cost (55,000 cr maintenance) that exceeded the revenue from the small guest pool. While I correctly identified the capacity bottleneck, the resort's popularity was too low (6%) to sustain that overhead. I entered a \"death spiral\" where I couldn't afford enough advertising to boost popularity because of maintenance costs, yet popularity was too low to attract enough high-paying Pros to cover maintenance.\n\n2. **Course Correction for Future Attempts:** \n   - **Keep it small:** Do not expand tracks or lifts until the current ones are near 90% capacity consistently. \n   - **Prioritize Popularity Early:** Invest heavily in advertising when your daily maintenance is low. Popularity is the hardest metric to recover once it drops.\n   - **Capacity Management:** Focus on filling existing beds before building new hotels.\n\n3. **Key Information:** \n   - Natural popularity decay is roughly 5-10% per day. \n   - Maintenance costs are deducted even if tracks aren't full.\n   - Popularity hitting 0% is an instant fail."
