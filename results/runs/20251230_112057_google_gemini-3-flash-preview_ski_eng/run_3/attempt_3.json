This explains why popularity dropped from 57% to 49%.\n\nFinancially, I have 134,000 cr. A ski lift with chairs costs 80,000 cr. Building it will leave me with 54,000 cr. My daily overhead (maintenance and advertising) will rise to roughly 40,000-50,000 cr tomorrow. Since I will have capacity for all 43 guests, my expected revenue will be approximately 86,000 cr (43 x 2,000 cr minimum per beginner), which will immediately replenish my account balance.\n\nMaintaining a liquidity buffer is essential, and 54,000 cr is just enough to cover one day of expenses safely before the next revenue cycle. By expanding the lift capacity to 60, I stop the popularity bleed and maximize income from my current guest count.",

My daily revenue is now very strong\u2014yesterday I earned 210,000 cr (120k from beginners + 90k from pros). My daily overhead (maintenance + advertising) is 85,000 cr, leaving a net daily profit of 125,000 cr.\n\nStrategic Decision: I need to build a new lift and a new track to prevent the impending bottlenecks. Building both today (80k lift + 30k track = 110k) would leave me with 65,000 cr. This is exactly enough to cover my current 85,000 cr overhead when combined with the massive incoming revenue (210k+). However, to stay absolutely safe with the \"liquidity buffer,\" I will build the most critical item first: the Ski Lift. It is the hardest constraint. Once the lift is expanded to 120 seats, I will have the infrastructure to comfortably reach the 1,000,000 cr goal.",

With 436,000 cr on hand and ~376,000 cr incoming revenue, we have an enormous liquidity buffer. I should NOT take a break yet. I need to continue building to expand the capacity for the incoming wave of tourists. Since I've already built two structures today (Restaurant and Pro Track), and the menu is currently offering \"Everything is fine!\", it implies I might be forced to end the day soon, but I should check if I can build more to fix the Lift/Hotel situation before the day officially ends. Actually, the prompt only gives choices 1 and 2, meaning I must decide if I trust the current state for one more night. Given I cannot build more after choosing \"Build something\" twice, and the situation shows I still have 436k, I will \"Talk to experts\" to see if I can squeeze in more construction or if I must rest.\n\nWait, looking at the logic: I need more capacity. If I choose \"Everything is fine\", the day ends. I should see if the experts advise on the specific lift/hotel shortage.",
