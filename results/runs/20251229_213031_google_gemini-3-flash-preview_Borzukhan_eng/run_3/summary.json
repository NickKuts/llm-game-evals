      "failure_reflection": "REASONING:\n1. **Strategic Mistake**: The primary error was using \"loud\" items (grenades) in a stealth-oriented or high-security environment. While grenades are effective for clearing groups, the quest text specifically noted that the previous explosion attracted guards. Using a second grenade in a confined corridor was a logical death trap, as it likely triggered a structural collapse or summoned overwhelming reinforcements that led to the quest's failure screen. I also should have prioritized full healing at the camp instead of a \"quick\" treatment, as entering the final base with \"minor wounds\" reduced my tactical flexibility.\n\n2. **Lessons for Next Time**: \n   - Prioritize stealth or high-precision weapons (laser gun) when inside the base to avoid alerting the entire garrison.\n   - If the option to retreat or find cover (like the niches in the corridor) exists, use it to bottleneck enemies rather than resorting to explosives.\n   - Ensure maximum health before entering the final mission phase; \"proper treatment\" is worth the time.\n\n3. **Important Information**: The true base is located in the **Northern Mountains**. The Eastern Grotto is a dead end. The group of pirates at the mountain cave entrance is the final gauntlet.\n\nACTION: 0"

      "failure_reflection": "REFLECTION:\n1. **Strategic Mistakes**: The primary mistake was a failure of target identification and resource management. I assumed the Peleng in the reactor room was Borzukhan and exhausted my health/stamina \"concussing\" him, which proved fatal when the real Borzukhan appeared later. Engaging in a protracted shootout while \"seriously wounded\" is mathematically disadvantageous.\n\n2. **Tactical Adjustments**: I should have been more cautious with my health earlier in the quest to avoid the \"seriously wounded\" state before the final confrontation. If health allows, using the laser gun is usually safer, but at critical health, a shootout behind cover (the flyer) is high-risk. I should have considered if a grenade could have ended the fight faster, despite the risk to the ship, or sought out healing items in the base (possibly in the room with voices) before planting the explosives.\n\n3. **Key Discoveries**: \n   - The reactor is the \"weakest spot\" for the explosives.\n   - The Peleng in the reactor room is a decoy or high-ranking technician, not Borzukhan. \n   - Borzukhan ambushes you at the flyer after the bomb is set.\n   - The right then left paths from the canteen lead to the toilet and reactor respectively."
