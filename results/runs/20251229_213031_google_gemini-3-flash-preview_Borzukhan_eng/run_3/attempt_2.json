I assumed the Peleng in the reactor room was Borzukhan and exhausted my health/stamina \"concussing\" him, which proved fatal when the real Borzukhan appeared later. Engaging in a protracted shootout while \"seriously wounded\" is mathematically disadvantageous.\n\n2. **Tactical Adjustments**: I should have been more cautious with my health earlier in the quest to avoid the \"seriously wounded\" state before the final confrontation. If health allows, using the laser gun is usually safer, but at critical health, a shootout behind cover (the flyer) is high-risk. I should have considered if a grenade could have ended the fight faster, despite the risk to the ship, or sought out healing items in the base (possibly in the room with voices) before planting the explosives.\n\n3. **Key Discoveries**: \n   - The reactor is the \"weakest spot\" for the explosives.\n   - The Peleng in the reactor room is a decoy or high-ranking technician, not Borzukhan. \n   - Borzukhan ambushes you at the flyer after the bomb is set.\n   - The right then left paths from the canteen lead to the toilet and reactor respectively."
