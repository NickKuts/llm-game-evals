  "failure_reflection": "REASONING:\n1. **Strategic Mistake**: The primary error was using \"loud\" items (grenades) in a stealth-oriented or high-security environment. While grenades are effective for clearing groups, the quest text specifically noted that the previous explosion attracted guards. Using a second grenade in a confined corridor was a logical death trap, as it likely triggered a structural collapse or summoned overwhelming reinforcements that led to the quest's failure screen. I also should have prioritized full healing at the camp instead of a \"quick\" treatment, as entering the final base with \"minor wounds\" reduced my tactical flexibility.\n\n2. **Lessons for Next Time**: \n   - Prioritize stealth or high-precision weapons (laser gun) when inside the base to avoid alerting the entire garrison.\n   - If the option to retreat or find cover (like the niches in the corridor) exists, use it to bottleneck enemies rather than resorting to explosives.\n   - Ensure maximum health before entering the final mission phase; \"proper treatment\" is worth the time.\n\n3. **Important Information**: The true base is located in the **Northern Mountains**. The Eastern Grotto is a dead end. The group of pirates at the mountain cave entrance is the final gauntlet.\n\nACTION: 0"
