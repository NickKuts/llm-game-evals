At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",
