Using a grenade at the entrance (Step 21) alerted the entire base. Attempting to use the final grenade against a large group in a confined corridor was a high-risk gamble that likely resulted in being overwhelmed or caught in the blast radius while already injured.\n\n2. **Changes for Next Time**: I must prioritize full healing at the camp before engaging the base. If the camp treatment is incomplete, I should seek alternative ways to restore health or use stealthier approaches. Specifically, I should refrain from using explosives at the cave entrance to avoid alerting the interior guards.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- The **Northern Mountains** are the correct location of Borzukhan\u2019s base.\n- The forest is a trap/dead end that causes injury.\n- The eastern grotto is a secondary cave system but less direct than the northern route.\n- Explosives have a high \"noise\" level that triggers reinforcements. Conserve grenades for locked doors or bosses rather than generic patrols."

      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred because I used a grenade in close proximity to my only means of escape (the flyer) while it was already \"seriously damaged\" from the initial firefight. This led to the flyer's destruction and my death. Strategic mistakes: 1) Being too aggressive in the initial flyer approach (Step 10), which left me wounded and the flyer fragile. 2) Failing to heal in the canteen (Step 13), making later encounters high-risk. 3) Choosing a high-collateral weapon (grenade) next to a vital asset (the flyer) when my escape was the priority.\n\nNext time, I should:\n1. Use more stealth or tactical options during the initial approach to preserve health and flyer integrity.\n2. Thoroughly search the canteen or side rooms for healing items before proceeding to the reactor.\n3. Use precision fire (laser gun) instead of explosives when standing next to my escape vehicle.\n4. Remember that Borzukhan is the final boss; killing him is a success, but surviving the explosion of the reactor is the win condition.\n\nACTION: 1"
