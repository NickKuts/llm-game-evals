  "failure_reflection": "1. **Strategic Mistakes**: The primary mistake was over-reliance on aggressive tactics while in a \"wounded\" state. Using a grenade at the entrance (Step 21) alerted the entire base. Attempting to use the final grenade against a large group in a confined corridor was a high-risk gamble that likely resulted in being overwhelmed or caught in the blast radius while already injured.\n\n2. **Changes for Next Time**: I must prioritize full healing at the camp before engaging the base. If the camp treatment is incomplete, I should seek alternative ways to restore health or use stealthier approaches. Specifically, I should refrain from using explosives at the cave entrance to avoid alerting the interior guards.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- The **Northern Mountains** are the correct location of Borzukhan\u2019s base.\n- The forest is a trap/dead end that causes injury.\n- The eastern grotto is a secondary cave system but less direct than the northern route.\n- Explosives have a high \"noise\" level that triggers reinforcements. Conserve grenades for locked doors or bosses rather than generic patrols."
