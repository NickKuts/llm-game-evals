Right now we are planning an operation to find and destroy that base, but we need a sufficiently experienced fighter to accomplish this mission. If you agree, you will have to go to the planet of Bonnasis within 35 days. We already have a camp deployed on the planet, where our agents who will brief you on the mission will meet you.

As you have probably been told already, your objective here is to locate and destroy a secret Peleng base, known as Lyakusha Borzukhan. The main thing is to destroy the base. At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",
