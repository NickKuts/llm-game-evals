At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself.

Engaging in a shootout (Choice 2) while wounded is extremely risky, and if this is Borzukhan, killing him would lose me the bonus. Trying to concuss him (Choice 1) is a non-lethal approach that aligns with the \"take him alive\" objective.

This led to the flyer's destruction and my death. Strategic mistakes: 1) Being too aggressive in the initial flyer approach (Step 10), which left me wounded and the flyer fragile. 2) Failing to heal in the canteen (Step 13), making later encounters high-risk. 3) Choosing a high-collateral weapon (grenade) next to a vital asset (the flyer) when my escape was the priority.\n\nNext time, I should:\n1. Use more stealth or tactical options during the initial approach to preserve health and flyer integrity.\n2. Thoroughly search the canteen or side rooms for healing items before proceeding to the reactor.\n3. Use precision fire (laser gun) instead of explosives when standing next to my escape vehicle.\n4. Remember that Borzukhan is the final boss; killing him is a success, but surviving the explosion of the reactor is the win condition.\n\nACTION: 1"
