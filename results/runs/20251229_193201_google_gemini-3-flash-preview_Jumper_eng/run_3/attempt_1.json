Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

I previously checked Yellow-1, but the Accelerator likely resides on Red-1, Violet-1, or Blue-1/Green-1. Instead of rushing to Platform 3 of each row, I should systematically check Platform 1 of either the Blue or Green row after recharging at Violet-3.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- Recharging at Violet-3 (+12 ergo) is essential for the final push.\n- The teleport is a one-time reset; it must be used after scouting or when energy is too low to finish.\n- The unknown \"Accelerator\" is the key to finishing with low energy. Next time, I will route through Blue-1 or Green-1 to find it."
