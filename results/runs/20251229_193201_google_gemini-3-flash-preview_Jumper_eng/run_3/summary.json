I jumped from Blue-3 to Green-3, leaving only 4 ergo. In the Green row, distances to the finish are significant. By skipping Blue-4 (even if it costs more), I missed the final opportunity to evaluate the \"Accelerator\" mentioned in the quest rules, which is typically found on the first platform of a row (Green-1) and allows a 1-ergo jump to the finish.\n\n2. **Corrective Action**: I should prioritize finding the Accelerator. I previously checked Yellow-1, but the Accelerator likely resides on Red-1, Violet-1, or Blue-1/Green-1. Instead of rushing to Platform 3 of each row, I should systematically check Platform 1 of either the Blue or Green row after recharging at Violet-3.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- Recharging at Violet-3 (+12 ergo) is essential for the final push.\n- The teleport is a one-time reset; it must be used after scouting or when energy is too low to finish.\n- The unknown \"Accelerator\" is the key to finishing with low energy. Next time, I will route through Blue-1 or Green-1 to find it."

I prioritized moving to the Green row (Green-3) based on a desire for completion, rather than following the logic of the \"Accelerator.\" Because I had already established that Green-3 leads to a dead-end with insufficient energy in previous runs, repeating that jump was a logical failure.\n\n2. **Course Correction**: I must reach the first platform of a sector (Blue-1 or Green-1) to activate the Accelerator. This device allows a sector-to-sector jump for only 1 ergo, which is essential for reaching the finish line.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- The Accelerator is located on Platform 1.\n- To reach Blue-1, I likely need to jump from a low-numbered platform in the Red or Blue rows.\n- The Violet-3 charger (+12 ergo) is mandatory for success.\n- Maximizing energy by utilizing even-numbered platforms for battery swaps is vital, but secondary to finding the Accelerator path. Consuming 5 ergo for a jump when a 1-ergo option exists is the difference between winning and failing."
