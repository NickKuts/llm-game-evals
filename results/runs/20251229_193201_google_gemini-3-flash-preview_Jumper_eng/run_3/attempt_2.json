Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

This device allows a sector-to-sector jump for only 1 ergo, which is essential for reaching the finish line.\n\n3. **Key Information**: \n- The Accelerator is located on Platform 1.\n- To reach Blue-1, I likely need to jump from a low-numbered platform in the Red or Blue rows.\n- The Violet-3 charger (+12 ergo) is mandatory for success.\n- Maximizing energy by utilizing even-numbered platforms for battery swaps is vital, but secondary to finding the Accelerator path.
