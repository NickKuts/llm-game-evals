Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

  "failure_reflection": "I failed by arriving at Green-3 with only 3 ergo, which is insufficient for any further jumps (minimum jump cost is 4 ergo). \n\n**Key Strategic Mistakes:**\n1. **Inefficient Energy Management:** I underestimated the cost of backtracking. Returning to Violet-4 and Violet-3 to use the charger wasted precious ergo from my spare battery cycle.\n2. **Dead-End Discovery:** I confirmed Violet-5 is a dead end with no forward exits to the Blue row, yet I wasted ergo landing there.\n3. **Ignoring the Spare:** I reached the final row with a nearly depleted spare battery (2 ergo). Efficient use of the even-platform swap machines is mandatory to keep both batteries near maximum capacity for the final stretch.\n\n**Lessons for Next Time:**\n1. **The Violet-3 Booster is Mandatory:** Plan the path specifically to land on Violet-3 with as little energy as possible to maximize the +12 ergo gain.\n2. **Optimal Pathing:** Avoid Violet-5. From Violet-3, prioritize jumps that land on even-numbered platforms in the Blue and Green rows ONLY if the spare battery has significant charge.\n3. **The Final Stretch:** Ensure at least 4-5 ergo remains upon entering the Green row to reach the finish or an accelerator."
