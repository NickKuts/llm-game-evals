Returning to Violet-4 and Violet-3 to use the charger wasted precious ergo from my spare battery cycle.\n2. **Dead-End Discovery:** I confirmed Violet-5 is a dead end with no forward exits to the Blue row, yet I wasted ergo landing there.\n3. **Ignoring the Spare:** I reached the final row with a nearly depleted spare battery (2 ergo). Efficient use of the even-platform swap machines is mandatory to keep both batteries near maximum capacity for the final stretch.\n\n**Lessons for Next Time:**\n1. **The Violet-3 Booster is Mandatory:** Plan the path specifically to land on Violet-3 with as little energy as possible to maximize the +12 ergo gain.\n2. **Optimal Pathing:** Avoid Violet-5. From Violet-3, prioritize jumps that land on even-numbered platforms in the Blue and Green rows ONLY if the spare battery has significant charge.\n3. **The Final Stretch:** Ensure at least 4-5 ergo remains upon entering the Green row to reach the finish or an accelerator."

      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The failure occurred at the transition from Blue to Green. I reached Blue-2 with 9 ergo, but jumping to Green-1 (5 ergo) left me with only 4 ergo. My strategy relied on the \"accelerator\" on the first platform of a sector (Green-1) to reach the final sector for 1 ergo. However, I reached Green-1 with 4 ergo and the mission failed, likely because 4 ergo was insufficient for the final jump sequence or I miscalculated the cost of the exit. STRATEGIC MISTAKES: 1. I entered the final stretch with too little energy (9 ergo total) by not managing the Violet-3 charger more effectively. 2. I relied on an assumption about the \"accelerator\" location without having sufficient surplus energy to compensate if it required more than 4 ergo to reach the exit from Green-1. OPTIMAL PATH DATA: - Violet-3 (+12 ergo) is essential. - Even platforms allow battery swaps; utilize these to combine the highest remaining charges. - The path Yellow-3 -> Yellow-4 -> Red-4 -> Violet-4 -> Violet-3 is viable but requires higher entry energy to ensure the Blue/Green sector finish. NEXT TIME: Arrive at Violet-3 with a higher total energy reserve (better management of Battery #1) and try..."
