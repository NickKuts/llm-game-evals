Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

My strategy relied on the \"accelerator\" on the first platform of a sector (Green-1) to reach the final sector for 1 ergo. However, I reached Green-1 with 4 ergo and the mission failed, likely because 4 ergo was insufficient for the final jump sequence or I miscalculated the cost of the exit. STRATEGIC MISTAKES: 1. I entered the final stretch with too little energy (9 ergo total) by not managing the Violet-3 charger more effectively. 2. I relied on an assumption about the \"accelerator\" location without having sufficient surplus energy to compensate if it required more than 4 ergo to reach the exit from Green-1. OPTIMAL PATH DATA: - Violet-3 (+12 ergo) is essential. - Even platforms allow battery swaps; utilize these to combine the highest remaining charges. - The path Yellow-3 -> Yellow-4 -> Red-4 -> Violet-4 -> Violet-3 is viable but requires higher entry energy to ensure the Blue/Green sector finish. NEXT TIME: Arrive at Violet-3 with a higher total energy reserve (better management of Battery #1) and try..."
