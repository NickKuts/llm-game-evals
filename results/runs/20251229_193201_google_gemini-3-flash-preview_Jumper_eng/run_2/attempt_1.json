Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

Since no \"Complete\" or \"Talk to Professor\" option is appearing despite being at 97.5% capacity, and there are no spheres left to interact with, the quest reached a state where the bonus cannot be perfectly completed. However, Choice 8 \"Cancel the testing\" in the context of the Professor's dialogue (\"You lose nothing and can get some profit\") likely means submitting my current progress. Canceling the *bonus* test after completing the main labyrinth usually returns the player to the main reward screen. Choice 6 and 7 just cycle through the same empty platforms.",
