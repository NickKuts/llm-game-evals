This left me with only 1 charge for interior exploration. 2. **Critical mission failure - premature explosive placement**: Carl explicitly instructed to \"find the base's weakest spot\" before setting explosives. I panicked due to wounds and planted at a random corridor junction instead of exploring to find the actual weak point (likely: power generator, fuel storage, command center, or structural support column). 3. **Not utilizing remaining grenades**: Even seriously wounded with 1 laser charge, I still had 2 grenades. These could have neutralized threats while I searched for the proper target. **Next Time:** - Use grenades against grouped enemies (entrance guards), preserve laser charges for interior precision work - ALWAYS find the specified weak point before planting explosives - don't rush - Systematically explore corridors even when wounded - the mission objective takes priority - Consider stealth/avoidance when low on resources **Important Intel:** - Base location: Mountains north of camp, cave entrance - Entrance: Armed guard force - Interior: Corridor system with junctions and occupied rooms - Must locate SPECIFIC weak point before..."

The quest failed immediately after the second grenade, suggesting grenades were needed for the actual destruction mission, not just combat.\n\n**Key errors:**\n1. **Misunderstood grenade purpose:** Grenades likely required for destroying structural weak points (power generator, fuel storage, supports) - not just fighting guards\n2. **Could have used stealth/laser:** Option 2 (hide behind rock) might have allowed bypassing the large group without combat, preserving grenades\n3. **Mechanical application of tactics:** Applied \"grenades for groups\" rule without considering overall mission resource needs\n\n**What to do differently:**\n- **PRESERVE GRENADES for base destruction objectives** - they may be the \"explosive device\" Carl mentioned or needed to destroy structural targets\n- Use laser gun more liberally on guards (8 charges is plenty)\n- Consider stealth/evasion options when possible\n- Don't assume every grouped enemy requires grenade response\n\n**Discovered information:**\n- Base location: Mountains north (confirmed)\n- Entrance: Cave opening detected from air\n- Grenade at entrance clears initial guards successfully\n- Interior has corridor system with Peleng patrols"
