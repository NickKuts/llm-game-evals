At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

      "thinking_tokens": "This is a critical combat decision at the entrance. Let me analyze based on what I learned from previous attempts:\n\n**Previous attempt failures:**\n- Attempt 1: Used laser gun at entrance (consumed 8 charges), left with only 1 charge for interior. Failed because ran out of resources.\n- Attempt 2: Used grenades on BOTH guard groups at entrance, then failed immediately after - grenades were needed for something else or I had none left for destruction.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Guards are firing from a group at the cave entrance\n- I have 10 laser charges and 2 grenades\n- I need to preserve resources for interior exploration AND base destruction\n- The special explosive device is for destroying the weak spot (not grenades)\n\n**Analysis of choices:**\n\nOption 1: Shoot with laser gun (10 charges)\n- Against a GROUP of guards, might consume multiple charges\n- In Attempt 1, fighting guards at entrance consumed 8 charges\n- Would leave me with only 2-3 charges for interior\n- Risky but might work\n\nOption 2: Fly away\n- Abandons mission\n- Never acceptable unless absolutely necessary\n- Not the right choice here\n\nOption 3: Throw a grenade\n- Effective against groups\n- In Attempt 1, I noted that grenades would have been better for entrance guards\n- But in Attempt 2, using grenades on guards caused immediate failure\n- Wait... let me think about this more carefully\n\n**Re-examining Attempt 2's failure:**\nThe reflection says: \"I used BOTH grenades on guard groups before reaching the base's interior objective. The quest failed immediately after the second grenade, suggesting grenades were needed for the actual destruction mission.\"\n\nBut wait - Carl explicitly said I'd get a \"special explosive device with remote control detonator\" for destroying the base. So grenades shouldn't be needed for that.\n\nCould the failure in Attempt 2 have been because:\n- I used grenades at TWO different points (first group, then large group)\n\n\n- Maybe the failure wasn't about using grenades, but about how I used them?\n- Or maybe I died from wounds after using the second grenade?\n\nLet me reconsider. Carl said:\n- Laser gun and several grenades for fighting guards\n- Special explosive device for destroying the base\n\nSo grenades ARE meant for fighting guards. The issue in Attempt 2 might have been using them inefficiently, getting wounded too badly, or making some other tactical error.\n\nLooking at the current situation: This is a GROUP of pirates with laser guns. This is exactly the scenario where grenades are most effective against grouped enemies. I should use one grenade here to eliminate the threat efficiently while preserving my laser charges for the interior. One grenade here could neutralize the entire group, preserving laser charges for interior combat where enemies might be more scattered. I'd still have 1 grenade left for emergencies and 10 laser charges for the interior exploration and Borzukhan encounter.\n\nThe failure in Attempt 2 might have been from accumulated damage rather than grenade usage itself. Since Carl specifically mentioned grenades are meant for fighting guards, and this is clearly a guard group, deploying one grenade makes tactical sense. I'll use one grenade on this entrance group, keep the other in reserve, and save all my laser charges for interior precision work where I'll need them most."

The quest failed immediately after the second grenade, suggesting grenades were needed for the actual destruction mission, not just combat.\"\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read Attempt 2's reflection more carefully:\n\n\"**Critical mistake:** I used BOTH grenades on guard groups before reaching the base's interior objective. The quest failed immediately after the second grenade, suggesting grenades were needed for the actual destruction mission, not just combat.\"\n\nBut Carl explicitly said: \"You will get a laser gun and several grenades in case you run into armed guards... In addition to that we are going to give you a special explosive device with remote control detonator.\"\n\nSo grenades ARE for guards, and the special explosive device is for base destruction. But Attempt 2 failed after using both grenades...\n\nMaybe the issue in Attempt 2 wasn't using grenades on guards per se, but using BOTH too quickly without proper exploration? Or maybe there's a specific scenario where grenades are needed?\n\nLet me think about my current options:\n\n**Option 1: Run out and escape** - Abandons mission, NEVER acceptable\n**Option 2: Shoot with laser gun** - I have 10 charges, this is a LARGE GROUP\n\n\n**Option 3: Throw grenade** - My last grenade, but this is a large grouped threat\n**Option 4: Hide behind rock** - Tactical retreat, might allow stealth/evasion\n\n**Key consideration:** This is a LARGE GROUP in a corridor. Using the laser gun would drain 5-7 charges against them, leaving me with minimal firepower for the interior. The grenade would eliminate them efficiently and preserve all my laser charges, but it's my final one. I need to weigh whether I'll encounter another grouped threat that requires it, or if the laser gun alone can handle remaining obstacles.\n\nLooking back at Attempt 1's guidance about using grenades against grouped enemies at entrances while preserving laser charges for precision work inside\u2014this situation fits that pattern. But Attempt 2 exhausted both grenades on separate guard groups before failing, which suggests using grenades too liberally leaves me vulnerable later. I've already spent one grenade on the entrance guards, so using this one means I'll have zero left for the rest of the mission, just like what happened in Attempt 2.\n\nThe real question is whether I can afford to be completely out of grenades, or if I should preserve this one and rely on the laser gun despite the resource cost. If I hide behind the rock, I preserve all my resources while potentially finding a better tactical opening\u2014maybe the guards will move on or I'll spot an alternate route. That seems smarter than burning through ammunition in a direct confrontation."
