As you have probably been told already, your objective here is to locate and destroy a secret Peleng base, known as Lyakusha Borzukhan. The main thing is to destroy the base. At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

I'm ready! - This would skip getting information\n2. Why didn't you locate the base yourselves? - Background info, might not be crucial\n3. How do I find Borzukhan's base? - CRITICAL - I need to know how to locate the base\n4. How do I destroy the base? - CRITICAL - I need to know how to destroy it\n\nANALYSIS:\nSince this is the start of the quest and Carl is offering to answer questions, I should gather as much information as possible before proceeding. The two most critical pieces of information are:\n1. HOW to find the base (choice 3)\n2. HOW to destroy the base (choice 4)\n\nChoice 2 seems less important - it's background info that won't help me complete the mission.\n\nI should NOT choose option 1 yet, because I don't have the critical information about how to find or destroy the base. That would be a foolish move - going into a mission without knowing how to accomplish it.\n\nThe most logical first question is \"How do I find Borzukhan's base?\" (choice 3), because I need to locate it before I can destroy it. Finding comes before destroying in the logical sequence of the mission.\n\nAfter getting information about finding the base, I can ask about destroying it, and then proceed with \"I'm ready!\""

The choices are:\n1. Kill him (lose bonus)\n2. Step away (unclear purpose)\n3. Leave entirely (abandons mission)\n\nThis seems like the game is testing whether I'll make the right choice. Let me think about what makes sense tactically:\n\nIf I shoot him through the window, I kill him but lose the bonus. However, looking at the choices, there's NO option to burst in and capture him with my gun drawn. \n\nWait - maybe I need to think about this differently. Perhaps the game wants me to step away from the window (choice 2) so I can then kick in the door and capture him at gunpoint? That would be a logical next step.\n\n\nThe critical constraint Carl emphasized was preventing escape above all else. If I step away, I risk him noticing something or slipping away before I can act. But shooting through the window guarantees he can't flee\u2014though it costs me the bonus and any intelligence he might provide. Maybe stepping back is the right move to set up a proper capture, assuming the game gives me that option next. and then try to enter the cabin to capture him. This way I can hold him at gunpoint and demand surrender. Choice 2 seems like the right call\u2014stepping away from the window should open up options to confront him directly inside, which gives me a better shot at taking him alive and securing that bonus."

The wound isn't severe enough to stop me, and delaying risks losing the element of surprise. I need to push forward and find the base before the pirates realize Borzukhan is dead.\n\nThe swamp location tells me the base is likely hidden in terrain that provides cover - either the caves to the east or the mountains to the north. Since I've already ruled out the forest, I should investigate one of those two locations next."

This suggests something happened in the grotto that caused me to return to the flyer, or perhaps the quest skipped some steps.\n\nLet me think about what this means:\n1. I entered the grotto (step 23)\n2. Something must have happened (steps not shown)\n3. Now I'm back in the flyer (current situation)\n\nThe fact that I'm back in the flyer and the base hasn't been mentioned as destroyed suggests either:\n- The grotto didn't lead to the base, OR\n- I couldn't complete the objective there for some reason, OR\n- Something forced me to retreat\n\nSince Borzukhan is still marked as dead and my status is the same (wounded, 8 laser charges, 2 grenades), it seems like I explored the grotto but it wasn't the right location for the base, or I couldn't find/access the base there.\n\nCarl mentioned THREE possible locations:\n1. Mountains north of camp\n2. Forest south-west of camp (where I found Borzukhan's cabin - NOT the base itself)\n3. Underground caves via grotto in the east (just checked this)\n\nSince the grotto didn't yield the base (or I'm back for some reason), I should check the mountains (north). That's the only major location I haven't thoroughly explored yet.\n\nHowever, I'm also wounded. The question is: should I get medical help first or push on?\n\nArguments for getting medical help:\n- I'm wounded and might die if I take more damage\n- Better to heal up before the final assault on the base\n\nArguments against:\n- Time is critical - pirates will find Borzukhan's body\n- I'm still functional (not critically wounded)\n- Can heal after completing the mission\n\nLet me think strategically: The base is still out there. The pirates I saw earlier will eventually discover Borzukhan is dead. \n\nDelaying risks them abandoning or fortifying the base further. But I need to weigh this against the danger of engaging in combat while wounded. The game hasn't escalated my condition to \"critically wounded,\" and I've been operating at this level for several steps now, which suggests I'm still capable. The mountains to the north remain the only major unexplored location from Carl's three options."

The flyer gives me mobility and superior positioning. \n\nFrom above, I can pick them off while they struggle to land shots on a moving target. My grenades are better held in reserve for the base itself or emergencies. Choice 1 makes the most tactical sense\u2014I'll use my height advantage and precise laser fire to clear the ground threat."

My resources are depleted, but I still have enough firepower to push forward carefully. The game has consistently rewarded thorough exploration and strategic thinking. If I plant the explosive in a suboptimal location, I might fail to fully destroy the base.

Behind these two doors could be:\n- Kitchen/food storage (unlikely to be critical)\n- But also potentially: generators, power systems, or other infrastructure that supports the canteen\n\nThe fact that Carl emphasized finding the \"weakest spot\" suggests there IS a specific location I should target. A canteen itself isn't it, but the doors might lead somewhere critical.\n\n\nGiven my critical condition, I should try opening one door to scout for critical infrastructure. If it's just storage or kitchen, I can retreat and plant elsewhere. If I face heavy resistance, I'll fall back to the junction.
