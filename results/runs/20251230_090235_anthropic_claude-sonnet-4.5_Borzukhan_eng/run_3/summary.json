The game EXPLICITLY offered Option 3: \"Think over the best plan of action\" - which I ignored. After reconnaissance, I should have paused to strategize rather than immediately attacking.\n\n**What Went Wrong:**\n- Shooting through the window likely triggered defenses, alarms, or guards I hadn't spotted\n- The cabin was described as \"expensively furnished\" - likely well-defended\n- I didn't assess whether the stunner would work through glass or if there were security systems\n- I failed to use the \"plan of action\" option the game specifically provided\n\n**Key Lessons for Next Time:**\n1. **WHEN THE GAME OFFERS A \"PLAN/THINK\" OPTION AFTER RECONNAISSANCE, TAKE IT** - this is the game telling you to strategize\n2. Don't shoot through windows at high-value targets - enter the building first or find the proper approach\n3. Expensive cabins likely have security systems/guards\n4. After scouting, always use planning phases before acting\n\n**Important Intel Discovered:**\n- Borzukhan's cabin is in the southwest forest\n- Pirates mentioned mountains and coastal secret passages (unexplored)\n- The pirate base location remains unknown"

This was premature - I had JUST entered the base and explored NOTHING.\n\n**What Went Wrong:**\n1. **Panic over resources:** With only 1 laser charge left, I prioritized safety over mission requirements\n2. **Ignored the briefing:** Carl said \"find the weakest spot\" - not \"place it anywhere inside\"\n3. **Failed to use stealth:** I had unexplored left/right corridors that could contain:\n   - Structural weak points (support columns, generators)\n   - Ammunition/fuel storage (maximum damage)\n   - Central base areas\n4. **Forgot the remote detonator:** I could place explosives and escape safely WITHOUT fighting\n\n**Next Time Strategy:**\n- EXPLORE corridors stealthily before placing explosives\n- Look for: power systems, support structures, fuel/ammo stores\n- AVOID combat when possible (don't open doors with voices)\n- Trust the remote detonator for safe escape\n- Complete reconnaissance FIRST, then plant explosive at identified weak point\n- The mission objective is DESTROY the base properly, not just \"set explosive anywhere and run\"\n\n**Key Intel:** Northern mountains cave is the correct base location."
