At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself. If that is the case, you have the full responsibility of what to do, but it would be better if you mange to take the Peleng alive. If you manage to do that we will pay you an extra 1000 cr as a bonus. If you have any questions ask now and I will try to tell you everything I know myself.",

The aerial reconnaissance revealed something UNEXPECTED:\n\n**New Discovery:**\n- There's smoke coming from the middle of the swamp (south)\n- This was NOT one of Carl's three suggested locations (north mountains, southwest forest, east coast)\n- Carl explicitly warned: \"keep your eyes open and ears pricked, it is quite likely that we do not know everything, so do not let this information misguide you\"\n\n**Analysis:**\nThis smoke trace is suspicious because:\n1. It's in a swamp - difficult terrain, hidden location\n2. Not on Carl's list - truly secret\n3. Smoke = human activity (cooking, heating, generators)\n4. A SECRET base would be in an unexpected location\n\n**Carl's three suggested locations might be:**\n- Decoys/false intel\n- Less likely locations\n- What Earth intelligence THINKS, but isn't certain\n\n**The smoke is a concrete physical clue** - something is actually there, not just speculation.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- Going to the smoke could be the actual base OR a trap/decoy\n- But it's a REAL lead (physical evidence) vs. Carl's theories\n- In my past attempts, I went to forest (Attempt 1) and mountains (Attempt 2) - both had issues\n- I haven't explored the swamp location yet\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nAs Carl said, \"do not let this information misguide you\" - meaning don't ONLY rely on his three locations. The smoke is objective evidence of activity. A skilled ranger would investigate unusual signs rather than ignore them.\n\nThis could be:\n1. The actual secret base (hidden in swamp)\n2. Borzukhan's personal hideout\n3. A pirate outpost\n4. Some other facility\n\nEither way, investigating smoke in a swamp where \"nothing should be\" is good ranger work.\n\nACTION: 1 - Fly to the smoke trace"

The pirates said they're \"delivering the prisoner to the base\" - meaning:\n1. They know where the base is\n2. They're going there soon\n3. I could FOLLOW them to find the exact location\n\n**From Previous Attempts:**\n- Attempt 1: I went to the cabin in the forest and tried to shoot through the window - failed\n- Attempt 2: I went to the northern mountains, found the cave base, but placed explosives too early without exploring\n- The cabin \u2260 the base (the base is separate)\n\n**Options Analysis:**\n1. Throw grenade - kills pirates, alerts base, lose chance to follow them\n2. Fly away - I could follow them to the base OR go to the cabin\n3. Shoot laser - same problems as grenade\n\n**Key Question: Should I attack now or follow them?**\n\nFollowing them would reveal:\n- Exact base location\n- Entrance procedures\n- How they enter securely\n- When the base expects them (I could impersonate or sneak in during confusion)\n\nHowever, the game only offers 3 choices and \"Continue listening\" is gone. The choices are:\n- Attack options (grenade or laser)\n- Fly away\n\nWait - \"Fly away\" might mean:\na) Abandon this location entirely\nb) Leave now to follow them from a distance\nc) Go to Borzukhan's cabin\n\nThe pirates haven't left yet - they're still sitting by the fire. \n\nIf I leave now, I'm either positioning myself to tail them or heading straight to the cabin. The status confirms I know where the cabin is, making it a viable target. But my actual objective is destroying the base itself\u2014Carl emphasized that's the priority, with Borzukhan likely being encountered there rather than at the cabin. Following these pirates to their destination would give me the base's exact location and security procedures, which seems far more valuable than hitting the cabin alone.\n\nThe issue is that \"Fly away\" doesn't explicitly offer a follow option. I'm choosing between engaging the immediate threat or leaving to pursue something else entirely. Given that Attempt 1's cabin approach failed, and these pirates are about to move toward their main operation, letting them depart and tracking their route to the base seems like the stronger play. him easily. Then I still need to find and destroy the base.\n\nFollowing the pirates to their base would let me locate it directly and possibly encounter Borzukhan there, accomplishing both objectives at once. The issue is that the game only presents attack or leave\u2014there's no explicit follow option.\n\n\"Fly away\" in this context probably means abandoning the pirates to pursue the cabin lead instead. Attacking would risk alerting the base and getting the prisoner killed. Since these pirates are heading to the base anyway, I could let them go, attempt a quieter approach at the cabin to capture Borzukhan, and then assault the base afterward. Though last time the cabin approach failed when I fired through the window without using the \"Think over the best plan\" option\u2014I should be more methodical this time rather than rushing in. I'm realizing the pirates just revealed something crucial\u2014Borzukhan spends time alone at a cabin to the west. That's a significant opportunity I shouldn't waste by engaging these fighters now.\n\nMy earlier mistakes came from acting too hastily. The game is giving me an exit, and I should take it. If I attack the pirates, I'll compromise stealth, burn resources, and risk the prisoner's life. Instead, I can slip away, locate Borzukhan at the cabin while he's isolated, capture him for interrogation, and use whatever intel he provides to hit the base with a real advantage. This methodical approach\u2014avoiding combat now to gain leverage later\u2014is fundamentally different from my previous rushed tactics.\n\nI'm flying away to pursue the cabin lead."

There must have been a fight - I got wounded and killed him (probably had to shoot him when he resisted). I lost the 1000cr alive bonus and the chance to interrogate him for base intel.\n\n**Primary Mission Still Active:**\nThe main objective is to DESTROY THE BASE. Borzukhan's death doesn't change that - Carl said \"The main thing is to destroy the base.\"\n\n**Current Choices:**\n1. Go north to mountains (suspected base location from Carl's intel)\n2. Go to the east to the sea (another suspected location)\n3. Go back to camp for medical assistance\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\nFrom previous attempts, I know the base is in the northern mountains. But I need to think about my current state:\n- I'm WOUNDED - how severe is this?\n- I still have 8 laser charges and 2 grenades\n- The mission is time-sensitive (pirates might find Borzukhan's body)\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nThe wounded status is concerning. However:\n- The game gives me the option to CONTINUE to the mountains/sea\n- If I were critically wounded, the game would likely force me to get treatment\n- Going back to camp wastes time and might allow the base to be alerted\n- I lost the interrogation opportunity, but from previous attempts I know the base location\n\n**From Previous Failures:**\n- Attempt 2: I found the base in the northern mountains (in a cave), but failed because I placed explosives at the first corridor entrance instead of exploring to find the \"weakest spot\"\n\n**Decision:**\nI should go to the northern mountains to find the base. \n\nThe injury doesn't seem critical since the game is presenting it as a choice rather than forcing treatment. My combat resources remain adequate for the mission ahead, and delaying to seek medical care risks alerting the base. I know from experience where to find it - the mountains hold the answer."

The pirates also referenced secret passages along the coast in my first attempt. There's likely an unguarded back entrance through the eastern grotto that connects to the same base. Retreating preserves my combat capability and lets me infiltrate stealthily rather than fighting through the front door.
