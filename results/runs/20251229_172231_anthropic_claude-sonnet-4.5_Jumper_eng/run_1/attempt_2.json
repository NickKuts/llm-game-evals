We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

I need to find it before committing to a path forward.\n\n**Optimal strategy:**\nYellow-1 seems like the right place to check next. The 7 ergo jump there leaves me with 6 ergo, and if the accelerator is there, I'm in a much stronger position. Even if it's not, I'd still have options\u2014I could backtrack to Yellow-2 for a battery swap or attempt Red-1 depending on the distances. The risk is that 6 ergo remaining might be tight if the accelerator isn't there, so I need to think through what happens in that scenario before committing.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Yellow-4 costs only 4 ergo to reach, and I could swap to Battery #2 there for a fresh 20 ergo. That would let me explore more systematically from a stronger position. But I have 13 ergo now, which is already substantial\u2014I don't necessarily need to swap yet.\n\nThe real question is whether checking Yellow-1 for the accelerator is worth 7 ergo. If it's there, that's a game-changer, saving roughly 14 ergo per row. If it's not, I've at least eliminated one location. That information gain might justify the cost.\n\nThe risk is manageable too. If Yellow-1 has no accelerator, I'd have 6 ergo left, which is enough to reach Yellow-2 (around 5 ergo) where I can swap batteries. That gives me a safety net, so exploring Yellow-1 seems like a reasonable play.\n\nSince the accelerator is likely on the first platform of whichever row contains it, and I'm already in the Yellow row, checking Yellow-1 first makes the most sense\u2014it's the most efficient path forward."

Let me analyze my situation:\n\n**Current resources:**\n- Battery #2 (active): 16 ergo\n- Battery #1 (spare): 1 ergo\n- Total available: 17 ergo\n\n**Jump cost analysis:**\n- Red-2: 5m = 7 ergo (even platform, battery swap)\n- Red-4: 5m = 7 ergo (even platform, battery swap)\n- Violet-2: 8m = 10 ergo (even platform, battery swap)\n- Violet-3: 9m = 15 ergo (CHARGER: +12 ergo!)\n- Violet-4: 5m = 7 ergo (even platform, battery swap)\n\n**Critical strategic consideration:**\n\nThe ACCELERATOR is still unfound. I haven't checked Red-1 yet. From my reflection notes, the accelerator is on \"the first platform of some row\" and only costs 1 ergo to jump to the next row's first platform (vs 10-15 ergo normally).\n\nHowever, looking at my options, I CANNOT reach Red-1 from Red-3. The options don't include it, which means Red-1 is likely too far or in a different direction.\n\n**Should I go to Violet-3 for the charger?**\n\nViolet-3 costs 9-12m = 15 ergo (it says 9 meters, so it should be in the 9-12m range = 15 ergo)\n- Current: 16 ergo\n- After jump: 16 - 15 = 1 ergo\n- Then charger adds: 1 + 12 = 13 ergo\n\nThis would give me 13 ergo on Battery #2 + 1 ergo on Battery #1 = 14 ergo total.\n\n\nBut I need to consider what comes after. Reaching Blue row, then Green row, then the Final platform with only 14 ergo is risky. Going to Violet-4 instead costs just 7 ergo, leaving me with 9 ergo, though my spare battery won't help since it only has 1 ergo. The charger at Violet-3 is tempting, but I'm uncertain if 14 ergo total will be enough for the remaining jumps.\n\nActually, the charger fundamentally changes the math. Spending 15 ergo to gain 12 back nets only 3 ergo in cost, leaving me with 13 ergo plus my spare battery\u2014enough to reach the Final platform through Blue and Green rows.\n\nBut I'm uncertain about the jump distances between color zones. If each transition costs 7-10 ergo, I'd need 21-30 ergo total, which exceeds my 14 ergo reserve. The teleporter might be the key to bridging this gap without burning through my remaining energy.\n\nAlternatively, I could optimize my path through the Violet platforms first. Violet-4 only costs 7 ergo, leaving me 9 ergo to work with. From there, I might be able to reach Violet-3's charger, which would give me more flexibility for the subsequent jumps to Blue and Green.\n\nThe real question is whether finding the accelerator is worth the detour. The professor mentioned it's on the first platform of some row\u2014I've already ruled out Yellow-1, but Red-1, Violet-1, Blue-1, and Green-1 remain unchecked. If I can locate it, the ergo savings could be substantial enough to justify the search.\n\nTaking Violet-4 seems like the pragmatic move. It costs 7 ergo, leaves me with 9 remaining, and positions me on an even platform where I can swap batteries. From there, I could explore laterally toward Violet-1 to hunt for the accelerator\u2014if I find it, jumping to Blue-1 would only cost 1 ergo instead of the 15 I'd spend going directly. That's a potential 14-ergo savings that makes the search worthwhile.\n\nBut reconsidering Violet-3 with the automatic charger changes things significantly. The jump itself costs 15 ergo, but the charger immediately restores 12, making the net cost just 3 ergo. I'd end up with 13 active ergo plus 1 spare\u2014that's actually quite efficient. Plus, Violet-3 sits centrally in the row, giving me better access to Blue row from a strategic position.\n\nThe real advantage is that I'm leveraging the charger resource while maintaining enough ergo to continue searching for an accelerator on Blue-1 or Green-1. And if things go sideways, I still have the teleport available to reset both batteries back to 40 from either Blue or Green row. This feels like the strongest option."

I've used 7 ergo on Yellow-3 and 7 ergo on Yellow-1, so I've already spent 14 ergo getting here. If 40 total is sufficient, then my remaining 10 ergo should theoretically be enough to finish\u2014but only if I haven't wasted energy or if there's an accelerator boost I'm missing. The fact that I haven't located the accelerator yet is troubling, and attempting Green-3 with minimal reserves feels like gambling with the finish line in sight. Yellow-2: 5 ergo\n- Red-3: 4 ergo\n- Violet-3: 15 ergo (but got +12 back, net 3 ergo)\n- Blue-3: 4 ergo\nTotal spent: 7+7+5+4+3+4 = 30 ergo\n\nI started with 40 ergo, spent 30, have 10 left. That seems about right.\n\n**Key question: Can I reach the finish from Green-3 with 4 ergo?**\n\nLooking at the choices, I can move to Green-3 from Blue-3. The fact that Green-3 is offered as an option suggests it's a valid path forward. But I don't see options for Green-1 or Green-2 from here.\n\nActually, wait - I notice the choice list shows options to use the teleport, go to Blue-4, reach Green-3, or use emergency return. There's a missing choice 3, which is odd. More importantly, there's no direct path to Green-1 from Blue-3.\n\n**The accelerator mystery:**\nI haven't found it yet. It's supposedly on the \"first platform of some row.\" I've checked Yellow-1 (just banana peel), but haven't visited Red-1, Violet-1, Blue-1, or Green-1 yet. If the accelerator exists and I haven't found it, maybe I should explore Blue-4 first, then try to reach Blue-1 from there. Or I could use the teleport to restart with better planning. The professor said I can use it \"just\" in case, which suggests it's available whenever I need it.\n\nIf I teleport now, I get 40 fresh ergo and can search more systematically. I can visit Blue-1 or Green-1 to find the accelerator. If it costs only 1 ergo to jump to the next row, I could save massive amounts of energy. But I only have 10 ergo left and don't know where the accelerator is, how far Green-3 is from the finish, or whether 4 ergo will be enough. The safe play is to use the teleport now while I still can, giving me full batteries and the knowledge I've gained about the layout to make a perfect run.\n\nBut what if Green-3 is close to the finish? The quest design suggests there's a reason Green-3 is offered as an option right now.\n\nI've been fairly efficient\u201430 ergo spent to reach Blue-3. If Green-3 to Finish is around 4-5 meters, that's 5-7 ergo, which means I'm cutting it dangerously close or will fail. The smart move is to use the teleport now, get fresh batteries, and make a calculated second run with better knowledge of the layout.\n\nBut the teleport can only be used once. If I use it now, I restart completely. If I don't use it and fail, I can't go back. Let me check if I can make it without teleporting: I have 10 ergo total, the jump to Green-3 costs 5 ergo, leaving me with 4 ergo for the final stretch. The distance from Green-3 to the finish is still unknown.\n\nThe critical issue is that I don't know how far the finish actually is from Green-3. Given this uncertainty and that I only get one teleport, I should push toward Green-3 and see what happens\u2014if the remaining distance is within my 4 ergo range, I win. Alternatively, I could detour to Blue-4 first to swap batteries and potentially scout Green-1 for the accelerator, though that costs 5 ergo and leaves me in a worse position overall.\n\nMy real goal here is reaching the finish line successfully. I'm at Blue-3 with 10 ergo total, and Green is the final row before the end. The game only offers Green-3 as an option from where I am, which suggests I should either commit to that path or use my teleport to reset and plan differently. Since I'm trying to win and avoid repeating past mistakes, the direct approach to Green-3 seems like the right call.\n\nThe teleport is my safety net, but using it now means abandoning 30 ergo worth of progress. The quest promised 40 ergo would be sufficient, and I've been careful with my spending so far. Green-3 to the finish is probably designed to be completable with what I have left. I should push forward and keep the teleport as a true last resort if I hit an impossible wall."

This means Green-3 \u2192 Finish costs MORE than 5 ergo.\n\nIf I jump to Green-3 now: 8 - 5 = 3 ergo active + 9 spare = 12 ergo total.\n\nBut wait - in first run I had 4 active + 1 spare = 5 ergo at Green-3 and couldn't finish. Now I'd have 12 ergo total, which is more than double!\n\nLet me think more carefully about the first run:\n- At Green-3, I had 4 ergo active + 1 ergo spare = 5 ergo total\n- The game showed ONLY \"Use teleport\" and \"Emergency return\" options\n- This means NO jump options were available with 5 ergo\n\nThe question is: what's the minimum ergo needed from Green-3 to finish?\n\n\nThe designer said 40 ergo would suffice, and I've burned roughly 28 getting here, leaving me with 17. If I can locate the accelerator on Green-1, I could finish from there with just 1 ergo. The real question is whether Blue-4 offers a path that leads me toward Green-1, or if I should risk Green-3 with my current 12-ergo total\u2014substantially more than the 5 I had before.\n\nLet me think through which first platforms I've actually verified. Yellow-1 was empty. Red-1 remained inaccessible. For Violet, I assumed it only had platforms 2-5, but if Violet-3 is truly the center of a 5-platform row, then Violet-1 should exist\u2014I just never reached it. Blue-1 is blocked from my current position. That leaves Green-1 as the most promising unchecked location for the accelerator.\n\nMoving to Blue-4 costs 5 ergo and opens potential paths to Green. If Green-1 holds the accelerator, I'd only need 1 more ergo to complete the puzzle. Otherwise, I'd have around 11-12 ergo remaining to navigate toward the finish, which seems manageable. The alternative of heading directly to Green-3 is also worth considering, but exploring Blue-4 first gives me better information about what's accessible from there. route, same as failed attempt)\n- Cost: 5 ergo\n- Remaining: 3 active + 9 spare = 12 total\n- In first run, had only 5 ergo and couldn't finish\n- Now have 12 ergo - is that enough?\n- Risk: If 12 ergo isn't enough, I fail with no options\n\n**The key insight:** I should explore via Blue-4 to potentially access Green-1 where the accelerator might be. If the accelerator is there, I can jump to finish for only 1 ergo. If not, I still have 11-12 ergo to work with.\n\nGoing straight to Green-3 now is risky because I'd miss the chance to find the accelerator on Green-1, and I'm uncertain whether my current ergo reserves would be sufficient given my previous failure there. Blue-4 offers a better path forward\u2014it lets me scout for the accelerator while keeping my options open."

But maybe I can access it from Blue-3?\n\nWait, let me reconsider:\n- Jumping to Blue-3 costs 5 ergo, leaving me with 4 active + 3 spare = 7 total\n- From Blue-3, would Green-1 be accessible? In my previous passage through Blue-3 (step 23), I only had options for Blue-4 and Green-3. No Green-1 or Green-2 were shown.\n- So Blue-3 doesn't give access to Green-1 either.\n\nThe accelerator is the key mystery. Where is it? I've checked:\n- Yellow-1: No accelerator (checked in first run)\n- Red-1: Never accessible from my route\n- Blue-1: Never accessible from my route\n\n\n- Green-1: Never accessible from my route\n\nThe accelerator might be hidden on a platform I've already passed through, or perhaps that comment about not remembering which row was a deliberate red herring.

Green-3 is the only forward option that makes sense\u2014it gets me to the final row. Even though my first attempt there with 5 ergo showed no viable jumps, I'm now carrying 12 total. After spending 5 to reach Green-3, I'll have 7 left, which might be just enough if the jump requirement is lower than I think.\n\nSwapping the battery would reset my active ergo to 3, which would eliminate jump options entirely\u2014that's a dead end. So I'm committing to Green-3 and hoping the extra 2 ergo opens up a path I couldn't see before.\n\nFrom Green-3, I might be able to reach other platforms in the Green row that lead toward the finish.
