Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

Battery management is crucial - use swap devices on even-numbered platforms\n4. There's a charger on Violet-3 (+12 ergo)\n5. I need to explore systematically and not rush\n\nRight now I'm at the beginning, being asked to choose. Let me analyze the options:\n\n1. Start the quest immediately - too hasty, need info first\n2. Get labyrinth configuration details - VERY IMPORTANT\n3. Learn about power consumption - IMPORTANT for planning\n4. Learn about additional devices - IMPORTANT (accelerator, charger, battery swap)\n5. Restate the task - probably redundant\n6. Learn about the Jumper device - could be useful\n7. Safety guarantees - not strategically relevant\n8. Abandon quest - NO, never give up\n\nFrom my previous reflections, I know I need to:\n- Find the accelerator FIRST\n- Manage batteries carefully\n- Route through charger if needed\n- Explore platform #1 of each row\n\nThe most strategic choices right now are:\n- Option 2: Get labyrinth configuration (which platforms exist, distances)\n- Option 3: Power consumption details (how much ergo per jump)\n- Option 4: Learn about devices (where is accelerator, charger, battery swap)\n\nOption 4 seems MOST CRITICAL because it might tell me where the accelerator is located. However, option 2 might give me the complete map which would be extremely valuable for planning.\n\nLet me think about what I learned from previous attempts:\n- The labyrinth has rows: Yellow, Red, Blue, Violet, Green\n\n\n- Each row contains platforms numbered 1-4\n- Battery swap devices are positioned on even platforms (2, 4)\n- Violet-3 holds a charger that restores 12 ergo\n- The accelerator remains undiscovered despite my searches\n\nA complete map would let me plan my entire route efficiently.

To get to Red-1, I need to think about the platform layout.\n\nLooking at my options from Yellow-3:\n- I can jump to Red-4 directly (8 ergo)\n- From Red-4, I could then work my way to Red-1\n\nBut wait - let me think more strategically. If I go to Yellow-1 first (7 ergo), I might have better access to Red-1 directly.

Option A: Yellow-3 \u2192 Red-4 (8 ergo) \u2192 then work towards Red-1\n2. Option B: Yellow-3 \u2192 Yellow-1 (7 ergo) \u2192 then jump to Red-1 (if accessible)\n3. Option C: Yellow-3 \u2192 Yellow-2 (5 ergo, with battery swap) \u2192 then to Red row\n\nLooking at my previous attempt reflections, I mentioned that when I was at Red-4, I couldn't access Red-1 directly. \n\nSince the platform layout doesn't allow Red-4 \u2192 Red-1 jumps, I should reconsider my approach. Yellow-1 might offer a direct path to Red-1 that Red-4 doesn't provide. Yellow-2 is also worth considering since it has a battery swap device and costs only 5 ergo, potentially giving me better access to the Red row. The key is determining which Yellow platform gives me the best route to Red-1 where the accelerator likely sits. I need to get there. The most direct path might be:\n- Yellow-3 \u2192 Yellow-1 (7 ergo) \u2192 Red-1 (likely 8-10 ergo from Yellow-1)\n\nOR\n\n- Yellow-3 \u2192 Red-4 (8 ergo) \u2192 work backwards through Red-3, Red-2 to Red-1\n\nActually, thinking about it more - in my previous reflection, I noted that from Red-4 I couldn't easily access Red-1. So jumping directly to Red-4 might not be optimal.\n\nLet me go with Yellow-1 (7 ergo). From Yellow-1, I should have access to Red-1 or Red-2, which will help me search for the accelerator. This is a conservative approach that keeps me with 6 ergo in battery #1 and full battery #2.\n\nWait, that leaves 6 ergo remaining in battery #1 after the jump.
