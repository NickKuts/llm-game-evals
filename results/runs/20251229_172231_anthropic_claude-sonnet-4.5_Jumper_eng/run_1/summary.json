Even-numbered platforms (Yellow-2, Yellow-4) have battery swap devices - I should have used them strategically.\n\n2. **Premature Aggressive Risk**: I gambled on finding the accelerator on Red-1 without confirmation. This was too risky early in the quest when I should have been conservative and explored the Yellow row more thoroughly.\n\n3. **Ignored Efficiency**: Yellow-3 cost only 7 ergo (5m jump) - the most efficient first jump. I chose Yellow-1 (10 ergo) based on speculation about the accelerator.\n\n**What to Do Differently:**\n\n- Start with Yellow-3 (7 ergo) - most efficient\n- Use even-numbered platforms to swap batteries BEFORE depleting them\n- Explore each row fully before advancing\n- Route through Violet-3 (central platform) for the +12 ergo charger\n- Don't gamble on accelerator location without evidence\n- The \"60 scores\" mention suggests mathematical puzzles - pay attention to numbers\n\n**Optimal Strategy:** Conservative battery management + routing through charger + mapping before committing."

I saw references to it but never systematically searched Red-1, Blue-1, or Green-1 where it must be located.\n\n2. **Poor routing priorities:** I rushed to the Violet-3 charger (+12 ergo) without first searching for the accelerator. The accelerator would save 35+ ergo across the entire quest - far more valuable than the charger.\n\n3. **Failed to explore platform #1 of each row:** When Red-1 wasn't accessible from Red-4, I should have jumped to Red-3 or Red-2 to create access. Finding the accelerator is worth any detour.\n\n4. **Insufficient ergo at Green-3:** Both runs ended at Green-3 (5 ergo first run, 7 ergo second run) with no options to finish. This suggests the finish requires either:\n   - The accelerator (1 ergo jumps)\n   - Access from Green-1 or Green-2 instead of Green-3\n   - 15+ ergo to afford the final jump\n\n**NEXT ATTEMPT STRATEGY:**\n- Prioritize finding accelerator on Red-1, Blue-1, or Green-1 above all else\n- Use \"backward\" jumps if needed to access first platforms\n- Find accelerator BEFORE using charger"
