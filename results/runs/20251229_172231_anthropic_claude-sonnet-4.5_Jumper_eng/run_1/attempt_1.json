Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

Start the test immediately - too hasty, I need more information\n2. Get details about labyrinth configuration - VERY IMPORTANT\n3. Learn about power consumption - CRITICAL for planning\n4. Learn about additional devices - IMPORTANT for strategy\n5. Repeat the task - redundant, I already know this\n6. Learn more about the Jumper device - might be useful\n7. Ask about safety/accidents - not critical for completing quest\n8. Refuse the quest - NEVER do this, it's abandoning the mission\n\n**Strategy:**\nBefore starting, I need to gather critical information:\n- How much power each jump costs (choice 3)\n- Details about the labyrinth layout (choice 2)\n- What devices are available (choice 4)\n\nThese will help me plan an optimal path. I should NOT start the test (#1) until I have this information.\n\nThe most critical piece of information is the power consumption (#3) because with only 40 ergo total (2\u00d720), I need to know if I can even complete the quest without using the recharge devices. This will help me understand if I need to find recharge stations or if I can go straight through.\n\nLet me prioritize:\n1. Power consumption (choice 3) - essential for planning\n2. Labyrinth configuration (choice 2) - essential for route planning\n\n\n3. What devices are scattered throughout (choice 4) - will inform my strategy for when to use recharge stations\n\nI'll start by asking about energy costs to understand the constraints I'm working with."

Teleport: One-time use on Blue or Green rows - returns to start with both batteries fully charged\n\n**KEY INSIGHTS:**\n- Battery swap on even platforms means I can access my spare 20 ergo when needed\n- The Violet charger (12 ergo boost) is on the CENTRAL platform (platform 3 of 5)\n- The accelerator is somewhere but unknown location - very useful at only 1 ergo cost\n- Teleport is a safety net but one-time use only\n\n**STRATEGY:**\nI now have all the information I need. The technicians say 40 ergo is enough, and with:\n- Battery swaps available\n- A 12-ergo charger midway through\n\n\n- An accelerator somewhere\n- A one-time teleport restart\n\nThis should be very doable. I have all the information I need to start the test. I should proceed.\n\nChoice 1: Start the test - YES, I have all necessary information\nChoice 2-7: More questions - unnecessary, I have what I need\nChoice 8: Abandon quest - NO, never abandon\n\nTime to start the actual test!"

If I can find it, it only costs 1 ergo to jump to the next row's first platform. This could save massive amounts of energy.\n\nYellow-1 is the first platform of the Yellow row, so it might have the accelerator! If it does, I could use it to skip to Red-1 for only 1 ergo.\n\nHowever:\n- Yellow-1 costs 10 ergo to reach (8 meters)\n- Yellow-3 costs only 7 ergo (5 meters) - most efficient\n- Yellow-2 costs 10 ergo but has battery swap\n- Yellow-4 costs 8 ergo and has battery swap\n\nIf Yellow-1 has the accelerator:\n- Jump to Yellow-1: 10 ergo (20-10=10 left)\n- Use accelerator to Red-1: 1 ergo (10-1=9 left)\n\n\n- Then I'd have 9 ergo + 20 spare = 29 ergo for the remaining 4 rows\n\nBut I'm speculating about the accelerator's location. Going to Yellow-3 instead costs only 7 ergo, leaving me 13 in the active battery plus my 20 spare\u201433 total for the remaining journey. The accelerator could be on any first platform (Yellow-1, Red-1, Violet-1, Blue-1, or Green-1), so I need to weigh the risk of spending 10 ergo on Yellow-1 against the safer, more efficient path through Yellow-3.\n\nIf the accelerator isn't on Yellow-1, I've wasted 3 extra ergo. Without relying on it, I should map out a baseline route: 40 ergo total, five row transitions plus a final jump, and the Violet charger providing 12 ergo along the way. Routing through that charger efficiently becomes crucial to my overall strategy.\n\nEven accounting for the risk, Yellow-1 seems like the right gamble. The accelerator would save enormous amounts of energy if it's there, and 10 ergo is a manageable cost if I'm wrong\u2014I can always recharge at other platforms afterward. I'll head to Yellow-1 first."
