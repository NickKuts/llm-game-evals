Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device. But keep in mind that the patent submission is due to expire, so you must do all the testing by 6 February 3000.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\nCurrent understanding:\n- I need to test a jumping backpack by navigating through a labyrinth\n- The labyrinth has a starting point, finishing point, and 5 rows of platforms\n- I can jump within a row or to the next row\n- Jumps consume power measured in \"ergo\"\n- I have two 20-ergo batteries (one active, one spare)\n- There are additional devices on platforms for battery replacement, charging, or returning to start\n- There's an emergency return button to cancel testing (but that means losing the fee)\n- My goal is to complete the quest successfully\n\nThis is the initial setup/briefing moment. I need to gather information before starting. Let me consider what I should learn:\n\n1. Option 1 - Start the test immediately without gathering info (risky)\n2. Option 2 - Learn about labyrinth configuration (IMPORTANT - need to know the layout)\n3. Option 3 - Learn about power consumption (IMPORTANT - need to know jump costs)\n4. Option 4 - Learn about additional devices (IMPORTANT - need to know what help is available)\n5. Option 5 - Repeat the task (not necessary, I understand the basic task)\n6. Option 6 - Learn about the Jumper device itself (could be useful)\n7. Option 7 - Safety/guarantees info (less important for completing quest)\n8. Option 8 - Refuse the quest (NEVER - this abandons the mission)\n\nThe most critical information I need before starting:\n- How much energy each jump costs (option 3)\n- The labyrinth layout (option 2)\n- What devices are available to help (option 4)\n\nI should NOT start immediately (option 1) without gathering this crucial information. That would be reckless.\n\nOption 8 is out - I should never abandon the quest.\n\n\nBefore diving in, I need to understand the energy mechanics first. Knowing the cost per jump is fundamental to planning any viable route, so I'll start by asking about power consumption. Once I understand the energy requirements, I can map out the labyrinth layout and identify where the support devices are positioned."

Yellow-1: 8m = 10 ergo\n2. Yellow-2: 8m = 10 ergo\n3. Yellow-3: 5m = 7 ergo\n4. Yellow-4: 6m = 8 ergo\n\n**Key information to remember:**\n- Battery swapper on EVEN platforms (Yellow-2, Yellow-4, etc.)\n- Charger on central platform of Violet row (adds 12 ergo)\n- Accelerator on first platform of some row (costs 1 ergo to skip to next row)\n- Violet has 5 platforms, so central = 3rd platform (Violet-3)\n\n**Strategy considerations:**\n1. Yellow-2 and Yellow-4 are EVEN platforms, so they have battery swappers\n2. Yellow-1 might have the accelerator (first platform of Yellow row)\n3. Most energy-efficient jump is Yellow-3 (7 ergo)\n\n**Important:** The accelerator is on the \"first platform of some row\" - this could be:\n- Yellow-1\n- Red-1\n- Violet-1\n- Blue-1\n- Green-1\n\nIf Yellow-1 has the accelerator, jumping there for 10 ergo would let me use it to skip to Red-1 for only 1 ergo total from Yellow. That would save me energy in the long run.\n\nHowever, I need to think about this more carefully:\n- If I go to Yellow-1 (10 ergo), I'd have 10 ergo left in battery 1\n- If there's an accelerator there, I can go to Red-1 for 1 ergo (9 ergo remaining)\n\n\n- If not, I'd need to continue from Yellow-1\n\nThe most promising approach seems to be targeting Yellow-2 or Yellow-4 early. Jumping to Yellow-2 costs 10 ergo, leaving me with 10 in battery 1, then I can swap to the fresh battery 2 with 20 ergo. Alternatively, Yellow-3 at 7 ergo is the cheapest option and preserves more energy in my current battery before deciding on a swap strategy.\n\nHowever, there's a compelling reason to check Yellow-1 first: if the accelerator is there, I could reach Red-1 for just 1 additional ergo after jumping to Yellow-1 for 10 ergo\u2014totaling only 11 ergo to reach the Red row. Without finding the accelerator, jumping to Yellow-3 would be more efficient for energy conservation.\n\nThe real question is whether the accelerator's potential value justifies the risk. I have 40 ergo plus a possible 12 from the charger, and I need to traverse six rows total. The minimum path would require roughly 20-42 ergo across 5-6 jumps, leaving me with a reasonable buffer. Since I have the teleport as a safety net, I can afford to explore strategically rather than play it completely safe.\n\nGoing to an even platform like Yellow-2 or Yellow-4 gives me the option to swap batteries later, which is crucial flexibility. Yellow-4 costs 8 ergo and keeps me in good shape, while Yellow-3 is more efficient at 7 ergo but locks me into an odd platform. I'll head to Yellow-4 to preserve my options and maintain the ability to adapt as I learn more about the layout ahead."

If the accelerator is on Green-1 and I can reach it, I could jump to the Finish for just 1 ergo.

Something is missing here.\n\nOh wait! The key is the first battery swap bonus: \"when you replace the active battery FOR THE FIRST TIME, its 7 ergo will move to the new battery!\"\n\nLet me think about this differently:\n\n**Current state:**\n- Battery 1 (active): 4 ergo\n- Battery 2 (spare): 0 ergo (spent)\n- Need total: 40 ergo\n\n**First battery swap mechanic:**\nWhen I swap batteries for the FIRST time, 7 ergo will transfer from the old active battery to the newly activated battery. This is a one-time bonus of +7 ergo effectively.\n\nLet me plan this out:\n\n**Scenario 1: Build up Battery 1 first, then swap**\n1. Use spheres to charge Battery 1 as much as possible\n2. When I swap to Battery 2, Battery 1's charge transfers 7 ergo to Battery 2\n3. Continue using remaining spheres\n\n\n4. If I collect all three spheres on Battery 1 first, I'd have 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 = 13 ergo. Then when I swap, 7 ergo transfers to Battery 2, leaving Battery 1 with 6 ergo and Battery 2 active with 7 ergo.\n\nBut wait\u2014the rule says the transfer happens \"for the first time\" I replace the active battery. That phrasing suggests something special occurs, not just a simple redistribution. Let me think about what the professor meant by emphasizing this as important. The spare battery starts at 0, so if 7 ergo moves from the active to the new active battery, the math checks out as a transfer, but there's something about the timing or the mechanics I might be missing.\n\nLooking at the actual numbers available\u2014three visible spheres providing +4, +2, and +3 ergo\u2014I'm only at +9 total. Even with the battery swap rule, I can't construct a path to 40 ergo. The passage mentions broken ceiling bars that once held spheres on platform 2, implying I haven't discovered all available sources yet. I need to explore what other sphere options exist, particularly on platform 2 where some appear to be missing or inaccessible."

I'm back on Platform 1 and I see the same spheres as before:\n- Sphere 1: 2m height, costs 4 ergo, gives 8 ergo (net +4)\n- Sphere 2: 2m height, costs 4 ergo, gives 6 ergo (net +2)\n\nAnd on Platform 2, I saw:\n- Sphere 2: 2m height, costs 4 ergo, gives 7 ergo (net +3)\n\nWait, both platforms have \"sphere 2\" - that might be a labeling issue or they're different spheres on different platforms.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Battery 1 (active): 4 ergo\n- Battery 2 (spare): 0 ergo (spent)\n- Need to add: 36 ergo total to reach 40 ergo (20 each battery)\n\nThe options shown are still only 1, 2, 6, 7. There are no options 3, 4, 5 visible, which suggests there might not be more spheres on Platform 1 than what I see.\n\nLet me think about this puzzle strategically. I have:\n- Platform 1: Sphere 1 (+8 ergo for 4 cost = +4 net), Sphere 2 (+6 ergo for 4 cost = +2 net)\n- Platform 2: Sphere 2 (+7 ergo for 4 cost = +3 net)\n\nTotal net gain if I use all three: +4 +2 +3 = +9 ergo\nStarting with 4 ergo, that's only 13 ergo total.\n\nBut wait - there's the battery swap bonus! The first time I swap batteries, 7 ergo transfers to the new battery. But Battery 2 is currently at 0 ergo (spent).\n\nImportant realization: The problem states \"when you replace the active battery FOR THE FIRST TIME, its 7 ergo will move to the new battery!\" This means when I swap, if my active battery has at least 7 ergo, those 7 ergo transfer to the previously spent battery.\n \nLet me trace through a sequence: I'll use Sphere 1 first (4 cost, 8 gain) to get Battery 1 to 8 ergo, then Sphere 2 (4 cost, 6 gain) to reach 10 ergo. Once I swap batteries for the first time, 7 ergo transfers from Battery 1 to Battery 2, leaving Battery 1 at 3 ergo and Battery 2 at 7 ergo.\n\nThen I can activate Battery 2 and use Platform 2's Sphere 2 (4 cost, 7 gain) to push Battery 2 to 10 ergo total.\n\nBut this only gets me to 13 ergo combined, nowhere near the 40 needed. I'm clearly overlooking something fundamental here. The professor mentioned battery replacement devices exist on each platform, and moving between them is free. Yet even accounting for the transfer bonus from swapping batteries, the three spheres only net +9 ergo, which isn't enough to bridge the gap.\n\nLooking at the available choices\u20141, 2, 6, 7\u2014the gaps suggest other spheres exist but aren't currently accessible. Perhaps they unlock after reaching certain energy thresholds, or maybe they only appear once I've used some of the visible ones. I should also reconsider what the professor meant about the battery swap. When they said the 7 ergo transfers \"for the first time,\" I need to clarify whether that's a one-time mechanic or if it applies differently depending on the battery's current state.\n\nIf the active battery has more than 7 ergo, then 7 transfers over during the swap, leaving the rest behind. This would mean I need to plan carefully around when to swap to maximize what gets transferred. With Battery 1 at 4 ergo and Battery 2 spent, I should map out which spheres give the best return on investment before committing to any swaps.\n\nLooking at what's available: Platform 1 has spheres worth +8, +6, and +7 ergo (each costing 4), plus Platform 2 has another sphere at +7 ergo. If I activate Platform 1 Sphere 1 first, Battery 1 jumps to 8 ergo. Then Platform 1 Sphere 2 brings it to 10. When I swap, 7 transfers to Battery 2 while Battery 1 drops to 3. Activating Platform 2 Sphere 2 on the now-active Battery 2 gets it to 10 total. But that's only 13 ergo combined\u2014nowhere near the 40 I need. I'm clearly missing access to more spheres or there's a different approach I haven't considered yet.\n\nThe most efficient move is to start with Platform 1 Sphere 1, which nets +4 ergo after its 4-cost activation. Let me begin there and see what additional options unlock."

I'm missing 16 ergo even after using all visible spheres and swapping.\n\nLet me reconsider the actual goal. Each battery needs 20 ergo individually. If I get Battery 1 to 20 and swap, Battery 2 receives the 7 ergo bonus, giving me a foundation to build from there.\n\nThe professor's wording about the first replacement is key - \"7 ergo will move to the new battery.\" This likely means a flat 7 ergo bonus gets added to whichever battery I switch to, not a transfer from the depleted one. That interpretation makes more sense given Battery 2 starts at zero.\n\nSo my approach is to maximize Battery 1's charge first, then swap to Battery 2 (which instantly gains 7 ergo from the bonus), and continue building both toward 20. I need to check if my available sphere resources can support this path - Platform 1 offers Sphere 2 for a net +2 gain and Sphere 3 for +4 (though it requires 7 ergo to activate), while Platform 2 has Sphere 2 available for a net +3 boost.\n\nWorking through the sequence: starting from 8 ergo, I can use Sphere 3 to reach 12, then both Sphere 2 options to climb to 17 total. Swapping to Battery 2 at that point gives me an immediate 7 ergo, putting me at 24 combined - but I need 40, leaving a gap of 16 ergo. There must be additional spheres I haven't discovered yet, possibly hidden on Platform 2 or unlocked through progression.\n\nI should check Platform 2 more carefully now that I've used Sphere 1, since new options might have appeared. The 5m sphere remains my best value play at this stage, offering a net gain of 4 ergo, so prioritizing that before exploring further makes sense."

But I need 40 total across both batteries.\n\n\nThe battery swap mechanic is crucial here. When I activate Battery 2 for the first time, 7 ergo transfers from Battery 1 to Battery 2. So if Battery 1 reaches 30 ergo before the swap, I'd end up with 23 in Battery 1 and 7 in Battery 2\u2014still only 30 total. This transfer doesn't create new ergo, it just redistributes what I have.\n\nBut wait, re-reading the professor's description more carefully: the bonus feature suggests Battery 2 receives an *additional* 7 ergo when first activated, not a transfer. That would mean Battery 1 stays at 30 while Battery 2 gains 7 as a bonus, giving me 37 total. I need to clarify which interpretation is correct to figure out if I can actually reach 40.\n\nLooking at the sphere visibility pattern, it seems like new spheres unlock as I gain more energy. Sphere 1 on Platform 2 only appeared after I accumulated enough ergo to potentially reach it. If I continue targeting the highest-value spheres available, I might unlock additional ones that could bridge the 3-ergo gap to 40.\n\nSphere 1 on Platform 2 offers +5 net value and costs 10 ergo to reach\u2014I have 13, so it's accessible. Using it would bring me to 18 ergo, and the energy gain might trigger more spheres to become available."

Total: 18 + 19 = 37 ergo - STILL 3 SHORT!\n\nBoth paths lead to 37 ergo, not 40. Something's off. Maybe I haven't discovered all available spheres yet.

Let me think about the battery swap bonus more carefully.\n\n**The battery swap rule:** \"When you replace the active battery FOR THE FIRST TIME, its 7 ergo will move to the new battery!\"\n\nThis means:\n- If Battery 1 has X ergo when I first swap, 7 ergo transfers to Battery 2\n- Battery 1 loses 7 ergo, Battery 2 gains 7 ergo\n- Net effect: 0 change in total energy, just redistribution\n\n\n- The swap itself doesn't generate energy, it only redistributes what's already there\n\nSo swapping when Battery 1 has 15 ergo would leave me with 8 ergo in the spare and 7 in the active\u2014the total stays the same. The battery swap is purely a redistribution mechanism, not a source of additional energy.\n\nThe real constraint is that each battery maxes out at 20 ergo. With the remaining spheres providing +22 ergo total, I can't simply fill Battery 1 to capacity and expect Battery 2 to reach 20 as well. I need to figure out the right moment to swap so both batteries end up at their maximum.\n\nThe first swap is key\u2014it transfers 7 ergo from whichever battery I'm replacing to the new one. If I time this correctly, I can use that bonus transfer to help Battery 2 reach 20 without wasting any ergo on an already-full Battery 1.\n\nI have 18 ergo total and need 40, so I'm looking at collecting the remaining +22 from spheres. Since that's exactly what's available, I should be able to reach my goal if I'm strategic about when I swap and which battery I'm charging at each step.\n\nMy approach is to first max out Battery 1 with a +2 collection, then swap to transfer 7 ergo to Battery 2, leaving me with 13 ergo on the spare. From there I can collect the remaining +13 needed to fill Battery 2 to 20 ergo.\n\nStarting with Battery 1 at 18 and Battery 2 empty, I'll use Sphere 2 to gain +2 net ergo, bringing Battery 1 to exactly 20. Once I swap, Battery 1 drops to 13 while Battery 2 jumps to 7, positioning me to collect the final spheres and reach 20 on the active battery. Sphere 2 brings B1 to exactly 20 ergo."
