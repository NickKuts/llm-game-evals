Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

This is a critical opportunity I shouldn't miss.\n\nFrom Violet-3, I'll then be able to jump to Blue row and continue toward the finish with more energy than I have now."

In my first attempt, I panicked here and used the teleport when I had 20 ergo. But now I've already used the teleport, so I MUST complete this run or fail the quest.\n\nOptions:\n2. To Blue-4 (4m = 5 ergo): Staying in Blue row\n   - Would cost 5 ergo \u2192 10 active + 5 spare = 15 total remaining\n   - Blue-4 is an even platform (has battery swap)\n\n3. To Green-2 (8m = 10 ergo): Moving forward to Green row\n   - Would cost 10 ergo \u2192 5 active + 5 spare = 10 total remaining\n   - Green-2 is an even platform (has battery swap)\n\n4. To Green-3 (4m = 5 ergo): Moving forward to Green row\n   - Would cost 5 ergo \u2192 10 active + 5 spare = 15 total remaining\n   - Green-3 is an odd platform (no battery swap)\n\n5. Emergency return: Quest failure\n\nI need to think about the path to completion:\n- Current row: Blue\n- Next row: Green (3 platforms: Green-1, Green-2, Green-3)\n- Then: Finish point\n\nI have 20 ergo total. I need to:\n1. Get to Green row (costs either 10 ergo to Green-2 or 5 ergo to Green-3)\n2. Then jump from Green platform to Finish (unknown distance)\n\nLet me think strategically:\n\nIf I go to Green-2 (10 ergo):\n- I'll have 10 ergo left\n\n\n- Green-2 is even, so I can swap batteries if needed\n- But with only 10 ergo total, I need the Finish to be within 8 meters (10 ergo jump range)\n\nIf I go to Green-3 (5 ergo):\n- I'll have 15 ergo left\n- Green-3 is odd, so no battery swap\n- But 15 ergo gives me enough for a jump up to 9-12 meters (15 ergo)\n\nAlso, there's somewhere an ACCELERATOR that costs only 1 ergo to skip to the first platform of the next row. The professor said it's on \"\n\nthe first platform of some row\" and it transfers you to the first platform of the NEXT sector for just 1 ergo. It could be on Blue-1 or Green-1, but I haven't encountered it yet. Since neither of my current jump options (Green-2 or Green-3) gets me to Green-1, the accelerator doesn't seem accessible from my present position.\n\nBetween my practical choices, Green-3 leaves me with 15 ergo after spending 5, which gives me a comfortable cushion for the final stretch to Finish. Green-2 would only leave 10 ergo, cutting it closer. I'm leaning toward Green-3 since the technicians confirmed 40 ergo is sufficient and I've been resourceful with my route so far.\n\nBut I'm second-guessing option 2 - jumping to Blue-4. That's an even platform with a battery swap device, though my current distribution (15 active, 5 spare) is already balanced. Unless Blue-4 is where the accelerator sits?\n\nNo, the professor specified the accelerator is on the first platform of some row - that would be Row-1, not Row-4. Blue-4 is just a sideways move that wastes energy.\n\nGreen-3 is my move. It costs minimally, preserves my energy reserves, and keeps me positioned well for the final jump regardless of whether I can swap batteries there."

The quest guidelines say I should \"COMPLETE THE QUEST SUCCESSFULLY\" - which I have done\n4. Taking on additional challenges could risk the primary completion (though they seem to be separate)\n5. They say \"You lose nothing\" - suggesting this is a separate side quest\n\nHowever, there's a subtle concern: they mention \"the batteries are spent\" and need to be charged. This seems to be a separate mini-quest with a different configuration. They're essentially asking me to do another labyrinth run to charge the batteries fully for demonstration purposes.\n\nGiven that:\n- I've completed the main quest successfully\n- This is clearly presented as an OPTIONAL bonus challenge\n- The reward is relatively small (1000 vs 65535)\n\n\n- It involves a different configuration I haven't mastered\n- My character has already hit my jumping target for the next year\n\nI think the prudent choice is to decline. I've accomplished the main objective, and pursuing a small bonus through an unfamiliar configuration when I've already secured the substantial reward doesn't make strategic sense.\n\nThough I'm reconsidering... The NPC explicitly states \"You lose nothing and can get some profit,\" which suggests this is truly optional and separate from my primary completion. If it's just another puzzle without jeopardizing my main reward, the extra credits might be worth attempting.\n\nBut I keep coming back to the same conclusion: I've already won. I'm exhausted from the journey, I've used my one-time teleport to get here, and I've successfully reached the winning ending. Taking an optional side challenge when I'm already satisfied with my victory feels like unnecessary risk. Option 2 is the right call."
