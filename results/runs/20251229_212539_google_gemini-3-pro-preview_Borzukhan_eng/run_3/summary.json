While tactically sound in reality, in this specific quest, throwing a grenade in a confined cave tunnel often causes a cave-in, killing the player instantly or blocking the path permanently. I assumed \"large group = area of effect weapon\" without considering the environment (cave stability). I likely killed myself with the collapse.\n\n2.  **What to do differently:** Next time, when facing the group of Pelengs in the corridor, I should choose to engage them with the laser gun or look for cover, rather than using heavy explosives indoors. The corridor might provide cover that makes a gunfight viable, or perhaps there is a retreat-and-ambush option.\n\n3.  **Important Information:**\n    *   **Location:** The base is definitely in the **Mountains (North)**.\n    *   **False Leads:** The Forest contains Borzukhan's cabin (good for loot/intel, but not the base). The East/Caves are a dead end.\n    *   **Entrance Strategy:** Using a grenade on the *outside* guards (Step 30/31) was successful and cleared the entrance safely.\n    *   **Warning:** Confined spaces + Grenades = Suicide in this text adventure logic."

However, based on the prompt \"The quest has ended in failure... Final status: DEAD\", and my last action was `3` (Fire laser gun), I must deduce what happened. Wait, looking closely at the provided text: I selected action `3` in response to the \"large group of Pelengs\" in the corridor. The failure message appeared *immediately*. It's highly likely that engaging a \"large group\" head-on in an open corridor, even with a laser, is fatal due to being outnumbered. The previous failure (referenced in my reasoning) was caused by a *grenade* doing a cave-in. If both grenades (cave-in) and standing ground (overwhelmed) lead to death, the solution must be retreat or a different tactical approach. **Reflection:** 1. **Key Mistake:** I chose to stand and fight a \"large group\" of enemies in a corridor. While I correctly avoided the grenade (which causes a cave-in indoors), trying to outshoot an entire squad alone is suicidal. 2. **Correction:** Next time, when facing the large group in the corridor, I should **run back** or **retreat** (likely Option 1 or 2). This might lead to..."
