      "failure_reflection": "Based on the failure result, here is the reflection: **Reflection on Failure:** 1. **Strategic Mistakes:** The critical error was misjudging the tactical situation at the mountain base entrance (Step 30). I assumed the \"fly away\" option (Option 2) would allow me to loop around and land safely. Instead, the game treated this as fleeing the engagement entirely or getting shot down while exposing my rear to the enemy, leading to an immediate fail state. Paradoxically, aggressive action was likely required here despite the fragile vehicle. 2. **Corrective Action:** When encountering the pirates guarding the mountain cave entrance while in the flyer, I must engage immediately rather than flee. Option 1 (Throw a grenade) or Option 3 (Shoot them) must be the correct path. Given the \"group\" of pirates, a grenade (AOE damage) is logically superior to trying to snipe them one by one with a laser pistol from a moving vehicle. 3. **Key Intel for Next Run:** * **Base Location:** The main base is DEFINITELY in the **North (Mountains)**. * **Boss Location:** Borzukhan is in the **South-West (Forest)**. * **Eastern Coast:** The \"grotto\" in the East is a red herring/dead end. * **Optimal Path:** Go to South-West Forest -> Kill..."

      "failure_reflection": "REFLECTION:\n1. **Strategic Mistake:** In the corridor encounter (Step 18), choosing to throw a **grenade** (Option 1) inside a confined cave likely caused a cave-in or killed me in the blast radius alongside the enemies. While effective outdoors, using explosives in a \"long cave corridor\" is suicidal.\n2. **Corrective Action:** In the corridor encounter, I must use the **laser gun** (Option 2). The \"long corridor\" acts as a funnel (choke point), allowing me to pick off enemies as they approach without collapsing the tunnel on my own head.\n3. **Key Intel:** The \"special explosive device\" is for the base structure, distinct from combat grenades. Also, going to the forest first is a waste of health; the direct assault on the North (Mountains) seems correct, but tactical choices *inside* the cave require precision (laser) over brute force (grenades).\n\n**Note for next run:** FOREST IS A TRAP. Go straight to Mountains/North. Use Grenade OUTSIDE (Step 16), use Laser Gun INSIDE (Step 18)."
