At that you will most likely encounter resistance form Borzuklhan himself.

Given my \"seriously wounded\" status and unexpected return to the flyer, I'm theorizing about the omitted combat details. Could the prompt have skipped the fight description? Or was it a deliberate trap, immediately inflicting damage? Analyzing the prompt history strongly suggests this choice triggered a negative consequence, warranting further investigation into the combat design.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Survival**\n\nGiven my critical condition, the immediate priority is survival. The forest proved dangerous; I was injured without warning. My immediate inclination is to return to the camp for medical attention, leveraging my credits. Exploring the forest or mountains again while seriously wounded risks immediate defeat, so finding assistance is paramount to the next move.\n\n\n**Formulating a Plan**\n\nThe analysis continues to refine my approach. While the forest holds Borzukhan, the immediate threat of my \"seriously wounded\" state dictates a change of strategy. Returning to the camp for medical attention remains the most logical course of action, and I have funds. This prioritizes survival over immediate goal fulfillment.\n\n\n**Confirming Immediate Priorities**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the medical assistance option. My analysis has led me to believe that healing is non-negotiable, given my \"seriously wounded\" state. Continuing without healing guarantees failure, as combat is effectively certain death. The camp represents a safe haven. While I had a goal in the forest, the situation demands immediate survival, and the provided prompt makes it clear that my health is critical, thus making medical care a higher priority.\n\n\n**Revisiting Previous Choices**\n\nI've re-examined the prompt and realized I directly chose \"Move deeper into the forest,\" leading to the \"seriously wounded\" status. It seems this action either initiated a negative event or skipped the combat outcome, resulting in my current predicament. Therefore, healing is still the most appropriate choice to guarantee survival, despite the original plan.\n\n\n**Evaluating Choice 1**\n\nNow, I've fully grasped the significance of my \"seriously wounded\" status. The game's mechanics are clear: survival hinges on healing. While the mission's optimal path involves the forest, my current condition renders further exploration impossible. The newly available \"Go back to the camp and get some medical assistance\" option is the only sensible move, as any other choice would lead to certain failure.\n\n\n**Assessing the Immediate Danger**\n\nI've determined that \"seriously wounded\" is a critical condition, a game over state waiting to happen if I proceed without intervention. Given my previous action, \"Move deeper into the forest,\" triggered this outcome, I must prioritize healing. The path to the mountains or forest is currently not a viable option.\n\n\n"

I was seriously hurt previously, but now it seems I'm only \"wounded.\" This could be due to a camp visit, though the details are unclear. I need to figure out where I stand before I can make the right choice.\n\n\n**Considering the Next Move**\n\nMy analysis has me at a crossroads. The game state shows \"wounded,\" indicating some healing since I was seriously wounded. My goal is to hit Borzukhan or the Base, but I was hurt badly in the South-West Forest. The question is: do I revisit, or reconsider the hub?\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Options**\n\nAfter the forest encounter, I'm facing a dilemma. The \"Optimal Path\" suggests the forest, but I recall past setbacks. Given my wounded state, the mountain base presents a high-risk scenario. The previous notes on mountain base entry are still relevant. I need to consider options carefully.\n\n\n**Considering the Implications**\n\nAfter careful review, it's clear the forest resulted in serious injuries. This implies a significant threat there, especially while \"wounded.\" I now recognize I was \"seriously wounded\", went back to camp, and got a degree of healing. Now I can try the forest again. However, the mountain base remains a high-risk option as I would have to fight guarding pirates while wounded. The notes indicate the need to engage immediately.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Current Situation**\n\nConsidering my current \"wounded\" state, a retreat was clearly required after the Forest encounter. After reviewing the briefing and notes, I'm leaning toward addressing the base in the North. Given the information, and even with the risk of pirates, it might flush Borzukhan out or otherwise change his position. I believe I have the intel and resources for the next step.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Current Choices**\n\nI'm assessing the core choices. I was seriously wounded in the forest, and went to camp for medical help. Now \"wounded,\" I'm debating my next move. The base in the North has guards. Borzukhan is in the South-West. I need to consider my state and previous setbacks before choosing.\n\n\n**1. Re-evaluating the Situation**\n\nAfter a thorough review, I've confirmed my current \"wounded\" status, an improvement from \"seriously wounded.\" The forest resulted in a setback, yet going to the camp was the logical choice. The mountain base presents a high-risk situation. My previous failure at the North highlights the need for a tactical approach.\n\n\n**1. Weighing the Options**\n\nMy \"wounded\" state gives me pause. The optimal path led me to the forest, resulting in a setback. While I've recovered somewhat, the mountain base still presents a risky encounter, even with my flyer in good condition. I must act decisively.\n\n\n**Assessing the Core Dilemma**\n\nI'm torn. The optimal path led to a setback in the forest. Now, wounded, I'm at a crossroads: risky combat in the North, or potentially another trap in the South-West. I need to weigh risk versus reward before acting.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Decision**\n\nI've considered all factors. The Southwest forest, while optimal according to notes, led to injury. Facing the mountain base directly aligns with the primary objective. The risk of losing Borzukhan's capture is acceptable.\n\n\n**Assessing the New Course**\n\nAfter careful thought and due to my \"wounded\" state, my past failure in the forest, and the known mountain base location, I've decided to head North. My flyer is ready for combat, and that location is my primary objective. I must deal with the guards first.\n\n\n"

I'm *at* the cave and presented the option to return. It's not a suggestion to revisit a previously-passed location. Based on this, I realize flying back *is* entering the cave.

I must proceed by engaging the cave and assess the pirates' threat level.\n\n\n**Deciding on Immediate Actions**\n\nMy current assessment is complete.

This also ensures the \"special explosive device\" remains available for the base.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Assault**\n\nThe Pelengs are advancing, and I'm still wounded. Using the grenade, as tempting as it is, is now less appealing. I just recalled that the \"special explosive device\" should be reserved for the base, so the laser gun is my only option in the close-quarters fight. I need to make every shot count.\n\n\n**Choosing The Right Tool**\n\nThe corridor is an ideal grenade target. With the Pelengs advancing, I've weighed my options. Despite being wounded and short on laser ammo, the \"large group\" formation necessitates the grenade. While I'd normally save it, the \"special explosive device\" for the base means I can expend this one. Tactical advantage in a confined space is clear.\n\n\n**Confirming the Tactic**\n\nI've considered all angles. The wounded status, the \"large group\" in the corridor, and the limited laser gun ammo all point to one clear solution. The special explosive device is for the base. This grenade is for the Pelengs. I need to clear the corridor quickly. Option 1 it is; I'm going to toss the grenade and end this quickly.\n\n\n"

  "failure_reflection": "REFLECTION:\n1. **Strategic Mistake:** In the corridor encounter (Step 18), choosing to throw a **grenade** (Option 1) inside a confined cave likely caused a cave-in or killed me in the blast radius alongside the enemies.

The \"long corridor\" acts as a funnel (choke point), allowing me to pick off enemies as they approach without collapsing the tunnel on my own head.\n3. **Key Intel:** The \"special explosive device\" is for the base structure, distinct from combat grenades. Also, going to the forest first is a waste of health; the direct assault on the North (Mountains) seems correct, but tactical choices *inside* the cave require precision (laser) over brute force (grenades).\n\n**Note for next run:** FOREST IS A TRAP. Go straight to Mountains/North. Use Grenade OUTSIDE (Step 16), use Laser Gun INSIDE (Step 18)."
