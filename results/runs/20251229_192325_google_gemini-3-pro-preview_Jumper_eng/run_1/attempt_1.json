We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

      "thinking_tokens": "**Contemplating the Start**\n\nI've just begun this puzzle, understanding the basic layout: five rows, a clear objective to reach the end. I have two batteries, and only one is active to start. Swapping them is restricted to even platforms, a critical detail.\n\n\n**Mapping the First Stage**\n\nMy initial analysis of the Yellow row options is complete. Landing on Yellow-1, Yellow-2, Yellow-3, or Yellow-4 each has a different energy cost, and I've noted swap availability. Now I'm focusing on the energy cost of each landing spot, comparing each against swap availability.\n\n\n**Evaluating Yellow Row Strategies**\n\nThe energy costs for each Yellow landing spot are now quantified, and I've started weighing the strategic implications of each choice. The possibility of an accelerator on the first platform of a row significantly alters the equation, particularly with the lower energy expenditure on Yellow-3. The need to reach Violet-3 (the charger) is shaping my decision, as is the critical importance of swap availability at even platforms.\n\n\n**Considering Swapping Dynamics**\n\nI'm now deeply considering the implications of battery swaps on even platforms. The current focus is weighing the value of landing on Yellow-4, which offers the swap option, versus the energy savings of Yellow-3, which does not. The charger at Violet-3 is still the primary target, shaping my evaluation of potential risks. If I don't swap now, I will be stuck on the current battery, potentially running out of energy.\n\n\n**Assessing Yellow Row Choices**\n\nMy analysis of the Yellow row options continues. Landing on Yellow-4 provides the best strategic advantage with the swap option, despite the slightly higher energy cost. Considering the accelerator's potential, my current thinking leans toward a more conservative approach, prioritizing battery management and the charger at Violet-3 over the risky unknown of the accelerator.\n\n\n**Assessing Red Row Entry**\n\nNow, I'm examining how best to enter the Red row, considering the implications of my Yellow row choice. Landing on Yellow-4 provides flexibility, as I can swap batteries. Yellow-3 leaves me with more energy, but limits options. My primary focus is to reach Violet-3, so I must assess the expected costs to reach the Red row.\n\n\n**Deciding the Yellow Route**\n\nAfter reevaluating the options, my focus has shifted again. While the accelerator remains a tempting possibility, I'm now leaning toward Yellow-4. It's an even platform, offering a crucial battery swap opportunity and providing a more conservative approach to energy management, key to reaching the Violet-3 charger.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Resource Management**\n\nI've made the decision to choose Yellow-4. It's an even platform, offering the critical ability to swap batteries, ensuring I can reach the charger at Violet-3. This strategic choice is driven by a focus on efficient resource management, prioritizing a reliable path to the goal over speculative gains, like the accelerator.\n\n\n**Deciding on Next Steps**\n\nMy strategy is taking shape. I'm choosing Yellow-4, leveraging the battery swap opportunity and a moderate energy cost. This decision solidifies my intention to reach the Violet-3 charger, which I believe is achievable through this choice, and I am prioritizing the safety net of even platforms for swaps.\n\n\n**Prioritizing a Stable Route**\n\nI've made the decision to choose Yellow-4, prioritizing resource management. While the accelerator is a tempting unknown, my main priority is to reach the Violet-3 charger, so Yellow-4 provides the most conservative approach.\n\n\n**Planning the Route**\n\nI've made my decision and am now focused on executing my plan. Yellow-4 it is, providing a swap opportunity. Next, I am thinking about the best way to leverage my battery swap to conserve energy and reach Violet-3.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Decision**\n\nI've weighed the pros and cons of each Yellow row option, considering energy cost, swap availability, and potential accelerator bonuses. My analysis has led me to prioritize resource management over speculative gains, and I will be choosing Yellow-4.\n\n\n**Planning the Next Move**\n\nMy analysis of the Yellow row options is complete, and I've decided on the safest approach: Yellow-4. This choice allows for a battery swap, which is a key element of the resource management strategy. My focus now is on what the jump to the Red row looks like, and planning to get to the charger.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Considering the Situation**\n\nI'm currently stuck at Yellow-4. Battery 1 has only 12 ergo left, while Battery 2 is fully charged with 20. The obvious move is to swap them, but I need to consider what the puzzle might require of me later. I need a plan before making any move.\n\n\n**Mapping Out Options**\n\nOkay, I've re-examined the costs and constraints. Swapping batteries is a no-brainer right now, and I've updated my internal map to reflect that. Moving to Yellow-3 and then on to the Red row looks like a risky strategy, so I'm putting that on hold for the time being. The safest bet is to conserve ergo until I know more.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Calculations**\n\nI've re-evaluated the jump costs and energy levels. It looks like jumping to Red-4 *before* swapping batteries leads to a slightly better overall energy state. I'm now comparing the two options again, but the core strategy remains the same: use an even platform swap opportunity to maximize ergo for the subsequent jumps.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm now running simulations, comparing the scenarios. It is clear that going to Red-4 and then swapping results in the same total ergo as swapping now and then going to Red-4. But I've recognized I need to avoid getting stranded on an odd platform. The safest move is still to swap batteries *before* any jump, and that is what I am focusing on.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Optimal Play**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the path of action that gets me the most usable ergo upon arrival, and considering the lack of other immediate options, it's clear I must swap batteries *before* any jump. The analysis reveals a strategic advantage to starting with 20 ergo. Any other move carries too much risk.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating the Strategy**\n\nI've realized that the layout of the Red row is unknown and that there may be an odd platform. Jumping *before* a swap leaves me stranded if the destination is odd, and reduces my active energy. So, I will choose to swap batteries *before* any jump. This gives me a more secure fallback.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Safe Navigation**\n\nI've decided to swap batteries immediately, preserving the most ergo in my spare battery. While a jump to Red-4 and *then* swapping might seem okay, the possibility of an unfavorable odd platform in the Red row makes that scenario too risky. This move ensures I maximize my active energy, giving me options.\n\n\n**Finalizing Battery Swap**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the initial battery swap. While the energy totals are the same regardless, my current strategy prioritizes a higher-energy spare battery. With the immediate swap, I will maintain the most ergo in my spare and avoid any pitfalls that might arise from an unfavorable platform layout. This is the optimal start.\n\n\n**Prioritizing a Stable Backup**\n\nI'm now fully committed to the initial battery swap. The calculations reveal that preserving a robust spare battery is the key. Swapping before the jump to Red-4 provides a safer, more flexible position for future moves, avoiding the risks of a nearly depleted backup. This action aligns perfectly with my overall strategic goal.\n\n\n"

Given my location on an even platform, replacing active battery #2 (13 ergo) with spare battery #1 (12 ergo) is an immediate tactical consideration, but I'm hesitant to do this. I'm focusing my attention on whether the next row's characteristics make a swap more advantageous.\n\n\n**Deciding on Course of Action**\n\nMy analysis indicates that swapping batteries offers minimal tactical advantage, so I'm now comparing the jump costs to neighboring nodes. Jumping to the violet row seems strategically better than traversing the red row, even though I'll be in range of both. The primary decision is whether to head to Violet-4 or Violet-5, and I am weighing the energy costs associated with both destinations now.\n\n\n**Evaluating Tactical Advantage**\n\nMy assessments have been updated to include the strategic jump options. Moving laterally to Red-3 seems wasteful. Jumping to Violet-4 is preferable to Violet-5, due to lower energy expenditure. My current active battery level will allow me to make the jump, but with just a little over half of its original charge remaining. The Violet-4 platform is also even.\n\n\n**Determining Optimal Trajectory**\n\nI've finalized my decision, and it's clear that jumping to Violet-4 is the most advantageous course of action. This keeps my active battery health in a usable range, and sets me up for a potential hop to Violet-3, thus securing the charger. The lateral move to Red-3 is a waste of energy and time.\n\n\n**Deciding the Course of Action**\n\nI've carefully considered the implications of each possible move. Swapping batteries is inconsequential. However, I can clearly eliminate the lateral jump and the jump to Violet-5, which appear detrimental given the strategic goal. The best path forward is to jump to Violet-4, thus setting me up to recharge at Violet-3.\n\n\n**Analyzing Optimal Path Forward**\n\nMy thought process is focused. I am now certain that the superior tactic is to move to Violet-4, given the details I have. I know that doing so will set up a hop to Violet-3 and the charger, and allow me to keep my active battery charged.\n\n\n**Deciding the Best Strategy**\n\nI've finalized my decision, and it's clear that the path to Violet-4 offers the most significant advantages. The lateral Red-3 move is strategically unsound. Jumping to Violet-5 would lead to exhaustion, and put me in a position without a swap.

I'm currently at Violet-4 with 8 ergo remaining on battery No. 2. I need to consider the energy cost of each jump and plan my moves carefully.\n\n\n**Calculating Jumps and Swaps**\n\nI'm reassessing the jump to Violet-3, calculating the energy expenditure. It costs 8 ergo. My current battery has precisely 8. Swapping is an option, giving me 12 in the active slot, but this is a gamble because I'm close to running out. I must consider if the charger is reliable with 0 power, I need to know!\n\n\n**Strategizing Energy Consumption**\n\nI'm deep in thought. The jump to Violet-3 is critical for accessing the charger, a free +12 ergo. If I jump directly, I'll arrive with zero, then 12. Alternatively, I can swap first and jump after. This leaves me with more power after charging. I'm focusing on the battery distribution for future platform navigation.\n\n\n**Assessing Optimal Trajectory**\n\nI've re-examined the decision: swap batteries before jumping to Violet-3, or jump immediately. The critical factor is battery distribution after charging. Swapping first seems safer. Arriving at Violet-3 with 4 ergo means a higher post-charge capacity, with 16 total. Conversely, jumping now leaves me with 12, after charging. Given the cost and the lack of swaps on the next platform, maximizing charge is my focus.\n\n\n**Refining the Battery Strategy**\n\nI've decided to swap batteries before jumping to Violet-3. This maximizes my charge post-charging, ensuring I'm at 16 ergo active, and 8 ergo spare. This distribution provides superior options for upcoming platform distances and conserves battery life. The choice is clear, 1. Replace the battery.\n\n\n**Revisiting Violet-3 Strategy**\n\nHaving confirmed the swap is allowed, I'm now fully committed to the swap-then-jump strategy. With 16 ergo active post-charge, I unlock longer jumps in the Blue/Green rows, which is my ultimate goal. The risk of the spare battery is offset by its use in a pinch.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Violet-3 Strategy**\n\nHaving finalized the swap-then-jump plan, I've confirmed it's the optimal route. Swapping now, before moving, is essential. This sets me up with an active battery of 16 ergo after charging, which unlocks a crucial range for future maneuvers and platform distances.\n\n\n**Planning Platform Movement**\n\nI've made my decision. I will swap batteries at Violet-4. The jump to Violet-3 is 6 meters, costing 8 ergo. Swapping prior, before moving, is essential. This ensures 16 ergo active, providing more range, essential for future platform distances and maximizing battery life.\n\n\n**Deciding the Battery Swap**\n\nI've reevaluated the optimal strategy, solidifying the importance of swapping before moving. With an active battery of 16 ergo after charging, and a spare of 8, I will have the range needed for longer jumps in the Blue/Green rows. The cost of one turn to swap before the jump seems a small price to pay to gain a superior battery distribution.\n\n\n"

Battery #1 is looking healthy, just recharged to 16 ergo, while spare Battery #2 holds a mere 8 ergo. My immediate focus is assessing the platform's energy demands.\n\n\n**Weighing Travel Options**\n\nNow, I'm examining the potential routes. Blue-2 seems attractive, an even platform allowing a swap, costing 7 ergo and leaving 9. Blue-3, costing 4 ergo, is less appealing as an odd platform. Considering cost, Blue-3 is tempting, though the risks of a costly jump to Green loom, I favor having a swap option, to make the correct move.\n\n\n**Considering Immediate Actions**\n\nMy analysis is continuing, prioritizing the balance of risk and resources. The even platforms Blue-2 and Blue-4 offer the possibility to swap, but the ergo cost seems unfavorable, while Blue-3 presents a simpler, cost-effective route, but without the safety net of an exchange. I'm calculating the potential jump distances to Green, evaluating the risks associated with ending up stranded.\n\n\n**Reassessing Tactical Options**\n\nI'm now carefully analyzing the teleport function, a potential reset with full batteries. My current power level, 24 ergo, is 60% of maximum. The accelerator is another option to push ahead. Considering the \"restart\" option, I feel compelled to continue, assuming I can complete the puzzle with careful management.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Teleport Option**\n\nThe teleport function is a tempting reset, offering full battery recharges. Currently, I am at 60% capacity, so I am strongly tempted to continue. Given my strategic gameplay so far, I believe that proceeding without a reset is likely the optimal decision, considering my remaining options. I'll need to carefully manage my energy.\n\n\n**Prioritizing Strategic Advantage**\n\nGiven the proximity to Green, and the benefits of a high charge, I've concluded Blue-3 is the optimal move. The 12 ergo remaining affords the greatest range for the next jump. I'm focusing on the potential energy demands of the Green row, weighing whether I can finish without relying on the teleport function.\n\n\n**Confirming Strategic Movement**\n\nI'm now completely satisfied with the decision to move to Blue-3. The cost-benefit analysis favors this choice by a considerable margin, affording the most energy for the impending jump to the Green row. My current assessment is that the teleport is there as a safety net, but I want to avoid using it if possible.\n\n\n**Refining Strategy Selection**\n\nI'm now implementing the choice. My aim is to move to Blue-3, preserving maximum energy. I have thoroughly evaluated the risks and benefits, and Blue-3 presents the optimal path forward for now, maximizing my range. I will continue the calculations for the next stage, while hoping I can conserve the Teleport function.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Evaluating the Situation**\n\nI'm currently assessing the critical situation. Platform 3 in Blue Row. I've got a charged teleport and active energy levels, but I have to carefully consider my path to the Finish line after the Green Row. I'm taking all this into account.\n\n\n**Considering The Options**\n\nI've laid out the available choices, considering the energy costs and platform locations. The teleport is out \u2013 no need to reset. Moving to Blue-4 is a sideways step, likely unnecessary. The most direct path is to Green-2, even with the energy cost. I'll need to swap batteries immediately upon arrival to stay in the game.\n\n\n**Choosing a Course of Action**\n\nOkay, I've reviewed the choices, cost, and distances to the Finish line after Green. Teleporting is out. Moving sideways to Blue-4 seems pointless. Green-2 gets me closer to the end, but the briefing's \"3 platforms\" has me rethinking. Green-3 is an odd platform, so no swap. I'm leaning towards Green-3, assuming the Final point isn't too far.\n\n\n**Choosing the Best Strategy**\n\nI'm now comparing the Green-2 and Green-3 options more closely. Green-3 leaves me with more total energy but limits my immediate burst potential to 7 ergo. Green-2 allows a swap, giving me 8 ergo. The briefing emphasized \"3 platforms\", which makes Green-2 more viable for the final leap. Green-3 might be risky.\n\n\n**Choosing, Then Justifying**\n\nMy analysis is complete. The options are clear, and I've crunched the numbers: Green-3. While Green-2 offers a marginal energy advantage after swapping, the \"3 platforms\" briefing detail gives me pause. Green-3 is the furthest platform. The finish should be near.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Path**\n\nI've re-evaluated the choices, now focusing on the immediate energy costs and final distances.  I'm eliminating the teleport as it's unneeded. Blue-4 wastes energy. Green-2 offers an energy advantage, but the briefing's emphasis on \"3 platforms\" still gives me pause. I'm leaning more towards Green-3 due to energy conservation, and, possibly, it being physically closer to the objective, depending on the game layout.\n\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nI'm now carefully analyzing the energy calculations, taking the platform numbering into account. I'm leaning heavily towards Green-3 due to the energy conservation. It puts me closer to the end, which the numbers do seem to show. The \"3 platforms\" detail hints the final may be near, making Green-3 the safer choice.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Choices Again**\n\nI'm now revisiting the options, specifically comparing Green-2 and Green-3. The briefing's mention of \"3 platforms\" keeps swaying me, and I've crunched the numbers on energy costs. Green-3 is the furthest out in the row. It has slightly less burst potential, but the overall energy savings are significant, and it should get me to the final stage.\n\n\n**Choosing and Analyzing Again**\n\nI'm deep in thought, evaluating the layout and the platform numbers. Green-3's the final platform, so it should be closest to the finish. I've re-calculated the energy costs and the briefings regarding the teleport. The 3-platform row gives me pause, but I'm looking at overall savings.\n\n\n**Choosing a Path**\n\nI'm now weighing the implications of each route: Green-2 or Green-3. The energy costs and the potential jump to the finish line are under consideration. The briefing's mention of \"3 platforms\" gives me pause. Green-3 is the last platform, so it might be nearest the end.\n\n\n**Considering the Final Leap**\n\nI'm now contemplating the jump from Green-3 to the finish. The briefing highlights \"3 platforms,\" making Green-3 a likely endpoint for this row. While Green-2 offers more energy after a swap, it's a longer jump with a higher cost. I'm focusing on conservation, which points towards Green-3 and its potentially shorter distance to the final objective.\n\n\n**Considering Choices Again**\n\nI'm now back in the loop, re-evaluating each jump to the Green row platforms. Blue-4 is a distraction, and Teleporting is a reset button, so I'm focusing on Green-2 and Green-3. I'm focusing on the potential energy left and the likelihood of the final jump.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Green Options**\n\nI'm now completely focused on the Green row, weighing Green-2 versus Green-3. The briefing's mention of \"3 platforms\" still gives me pause. I'm crunching numbers, calculating the energy costs and distances. I'm keeping a strong focus on energy conservation, while considering the final jump.\n\n\n**Assessing Current Strategy**\n\nThe path is down to two options now: Green-2 or Green-3. I've crunched the numbers, but I'm still debating the best course, as the final objective is unknown. Green-3 is the last platform, so it might be nearer the finish. The earlier briefing is also on my mind.\n\n\n**Choosing the Next Platform**\n\nI'm now carefully re-evaluating the choice between Green-2 and Green-3. I've re-calculated energy costs. The briefing suggests the final spot is close. Green-3 is the last platform, which means it might be very close.\n\n\n"

The previous prompts offered teleportation, a jump to Blue-4, or a move to Green-2. I'm reconsidering the initial premises.\n\n\n**Contemplating the Culmination**\n\nThe puzzle has truly hit a snag. Re-evaluating the jump costs and remaining energy, I realize my 7 ergo isn't sufficient for the presumed 6-meter jump to the Finish, costing 8 ergo. The lack of available options likely indicates an energy deficit preventing any movement, not a system glitch. The Green-3 location, being odd, further eliminates battery swapping as a solution, meaning I am stuck. This demands a revisit of prior choices.\n\n\n**Investigating the Missing Links**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on a potential system anomaly. The absence of options 2 and 3 in the latest prompt feels highly suspicious, indicating a possible glitch in the text formatting. Did the system fail to render the jump options? This is odd, considering the simulation's usual reliability. I'm focusing my attention on the implications of the missing menu items, and the potential consequence, that the jump options were simply not properly displayed.\n\n\n**Confirming the Impasse**\n\nI've replayed the options, tracing back my moves. The current layout confirms my suspicion: I'm trapped on Green-3 with insufficient energy for the final jump. The teleport, though, is the only clear path forward. This run is a learning experience, I must remember the previous paths. I need to get back to the start and replay the simulation with more care.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Reset**\n\nThe teleport is the only way out, so I'm forced to reset. Reviewing the failure, I now understand the energy constraints are key. The Green-3 situation clarifies that the 6-meter jump to the Finish requires 8 ergo. The initial path I took wasn't wrong, just energy-inefficient. I'm focusing on preserving more energy in this new run, maybe by considering the teleport much earlier.\n\n\n**Accepting the Impossibility**\n\nI'm forced to use the teleport. Analyzing the situation, I realize the last jump requires 8 ergo, and my path on the previous run, from Violet-3 to Blue-3, then Green-3, left me with 7. The path was valid, but not energy-efficient, the puzzle design has a cruel twist! The loop necessitates a restart with better resource management.\n\n\n"

Previously, I had a plan that involved swapping the active and spare tiles at Yellow-4. I then planned to jump to Red-4. This is based on the logic I already put in place. Now I must see if the teleport has changed anything.\n\n\n**Charting New Courses**\n\nI've been meticulously revisiting the path from the Violet platforms. My previous attempt, which ended on Green-3, failed due to an insufficient charge. The Blue row is where the issue lies. I'm focusing on alternatives, specifically Blue-2 or Blue-4. These offer even-numbered platforms and a potential swap opportunity.\n\n\n**Recalibrating the Route**\n\nI'm focused on the Green-3 failure point. I've replayed the path to understand how I got stuck with only 7 ergo. The key is now clear: an even Green platform is essential to swap. I'm exploring options that involve going to Green-2 directly, or altering the Blue row choices to allow a swap to then achieve Green-2.\n\n\n**Rethinking After Teleport**\n\nI'm restarting the maze, as requested, post-teleport. Reviewing the failure on Green-3, the key takeaway is the need for an even Green platform to swap.  Blue-2 or Blue-4 are critical. I see I can go to Green-2 from Blue-3. However, I have missed something important and will review the instructions again.\n\n\n**Pinpointing the Accelerator**\n\nI'm now fully focused on finding the accelerator, which drastically changes the energy calculations. If on Yellow-1, I expend 10 ergo to arrive then 1 to reach Red-1.  9 ergo could be risky at an odd-numbered platform, but I need to identify where this crucial energy-saving device is.\n\n\n**Evaluating Strategic Options**\n\nI'm now back on the Yellow-4 to Red-4 path, considering the need to conserve ergo. The accelerator's location remains unknown, and I'm still trying to get on Green-2 with enough ergo. I have 12 to 20 charge and must avoid the Green-3 trap.\n\n\n**Refining the Path's End**\n\nI'm focused on the endgame from Green-2. With 2 ergo, I swap to 8, but will that suffice? The Green-3 failure, where I had 7 ergo, shows that the finish line jump could cost 8 ergo. I am re-examining the distance calculation.\n\n\n**Reflecting on the Blueprint**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in re-examining the entire path, post-teleport. My strategy focused on swapping batteries, but now the accelerator is a factor. I'm prioritizing Green-2 and the end game, with a keen eye on the location of the accelerator.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Blue Pathway**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in reconsidering the jump to Green-2 from Blue-3. After the teleport, my goal is to maximize ergo to achieve the final jump. The \"scar\" warning on Blue-3 about the jump has me reassessing the risks. I think I will stick to the plan for now and test the Green-2 finish.\n\n\n**Analyzing the Blue Path**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in reconsidering the Green-2 and the accelerator. My plan is now: Yellow-4, then Red-4, then Violet-4, then Violet-3 (charge). From there, I will go to Blue-3 or Blue-2, based on the jump costs, and then jump to Green-2 to swap.\n\n\n**Revisiting the Strategy**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in a second full replay. I must re-evaluate the choices, particularly after the teleport. My initial assessment focused on the Yellow-4 swap. This allows for safe progress, but I should look at the accelerator.\n\n\n**Prioritizing the Safe Path**\n\nHaving replayed the scenario multiple times, I've concluded that the optimal starting move is, again, Yellow-4. I'll then move towards Red-4, Violet-4, then Violet-3. From there, I will focus on choosing the Blue-2 path, which is even, and going to Green-2, to swap. The accelerator is still unknown, so the safe path remains best.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Starting Point**\n\nI'm now back at the beginning, prioritizing Yellow-4 again. I've re-examined the starting options, confirming Yellow-4's optimal positioning. The goal is to set up for a battery swap, which improves the endgame. I must avoid the Green-3 trap.\n\n\n"

I'm carefully managing my ergo, down to 12 now. This second attempt feels different, maybe I'll find a quicker solution this time around.\n\n\n**Evaluating Path Options Again**\n\nI'm methodically re-evaluating the path, specifically focusing on the ergo management. The initial teleport placed me at Yellow-4. I've re-calculated the ergo costs for each jump, taking into account the swap options. I'm focusing on preserving ergo for the crucial Green-3 stage. I'm trying to optimize my battery swaps to avoid the dead end I reached before. My analysis is progressing well.\n\n\n**Reassessing Battery Swaps**\n\nI'm revisiting the critical decision at Yellow-4. I've broken down the two swap scenarios: swapping now, or keeping the current configuration. Analyzing the subsequent jump to Red-4 and the potential ergo impact is key. The goal is to optimize energy levels for the later, more challenging jumps. I am particularly concerned with preserving sufficient ergo at Blue-3.\n\n\n**Confirming Optimal Swap Strategy**\n\nI've replayed the path to Red-4, simulating both swap scenarios at Yellow-4. Analysis of the outcomes solidifies my decision to swap batteries at Yellow-4. Having 13 ergo at Red-4 is crucial for the path's success. This is due to greater flexibility. Now, I'm verifying the next steps, including ergo cost, and the swapping availability.\n\n\n**Finalizing Battery Replacement**\n\nI'm now fully convinced the optimal approach is to swap at Yellow-4. With the new battery configuration, I've re-traced the path. I've confirmed that the critical swap at Yellow-4 leads to a more favorable energy distribution for subsequent challenges. The potential for dead ends with a depleted battery is significantly reduced. This adjustment should lead to much greater success.\n\n\n**Verifying the Optimal Route**\n\nI'm now completely re-evaluating the route again. After the battery swap at Yellow-4, I'm analyzing the subsequent jump to Red-4. I'm double-checking the potential for the accelerator on Violet-1. The goal is to maximize the active battery at critical decision points, specifically Green-3, and avoid the energy pitfalls from the previous runs.\n\n\n**Analyzing Yellow-4's Decision**\n\nMy analysis of the Yellow-4 scenario is complete. The core decision remains clear: I will swap the batteries, just like before, at Yellow-4. Swapping now maximizes available ergo for future moves. The jump to Red-4 comes next.\n\n\n**Revisiting Yellow-4 Decision**\n\nMy analysis has narrowed down to the swap decision on Yellow-4, just as before. I have verified that exchanging batteries at Yellow-4 leads to a superior energy distribution for the rest of the run. This approach leads to more flexibility and prevents potential dead ends down the line. I'm moving ahead with the same decision.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Assessing Movement Options**\n\nI'm currently calculating the optimal path from Violet-3 to the Blue row. Considering two options: Blue-2, costing 7 ergo, and Blue-3, at 4 ergo. I've accounted for active and spare battery levels and platform availability for each scenario. Seems Blue-3 might be the more economical route.\n\n\n**Revising Strategic Pathways**\n\nI'm now revisiting the failed Blue-3 to Green-3 route. My calculations confirm the Green-3 impasse due to insufficient ergo for the final jump. This reinforces the need for a higher initial ergo level or a different pathway. I'm exploring if arriving at Green-3 with a full active battery, with no spare, is ever an option, now.\n\n\n**Contemplating Platform Strategies**\n\nI'm now investigating the potential of the Blue-2 and Blue-4 routes, given that both are accessible and allow for battery swaps. Since both options leave me with a 9-ergo active battery, with a full 8-ergo spare, the swaps are negligible. However, I need to evaluate the downstream advantages of each, mainly looking to find a platform with the \"accelerator\" that's been mentioned.\n\n\n**Reassessing Blue Row Options**\n\nI'm now prioritizing Blue-2 and Blue-4, having dismissed Blue-3. The goal is to reach the Green row, but the previous Green-3 failure necessitates careful planning. I'm focusing on battery management, specifically the advantages of even platforms for potential swaps and calculating energy expenditures across possible jump distances. I'm also now attempting to verify the existence and location of the previously-mentioned \"accelerator\".\n\n\n**Evaluating Potential Routes**\n\nI'm now carefully analyzing the implications of the Blue-3 to Green-2 route, realizing I may have overlooked it before. This path might be the key. I also need to confirm jump distances and costs, as well as the availability of platform swaps. My goal is to maximize ergo reserves while reaching a platform with favorable finishing options.\n\n\n**Recalibrating Pathing to Green**\n\nAfter thoroughly analyzing the data, I am certain the path to Green-3 is a dead end if initiated from Blue-3. However, I now believe the viable path is through Blue-3 to Green-2. This route utilizes the \"Even\" platform at Green-2 for a battery swap, ensuring sufficient energy reserves for the final jump.\n\n\n**Refining Route Optimization**\n\nI'm now revisiting the potential routes from Violet-3, focusing on Blue-3 followed by a jump to Green-2, to ensure there are sufficient ergo reserves for the final jump. This strategy hinges on battery swaps at Green-2, mitigating the risk posed by the high cost of the jump from Blue-3.\n\n\n**Reconsidering Path Selection**\n\nI'm now revisiting the potential routes, evaluating the crucial role of platform swaps. While previously favoring Blue-3, the limited jump distance to Green-2 made me pause. The potential presence of an accelerator on Green-1 is now a significant factor in deciding whether to risk going to Blue-2.\n\n\n**Finalizing Pathing Strategy**\n\nI've re-evaluated all possible routes and now firmly believe the most efficient path forward is Violet-3 to Blue-3, followed by a jump to Green-2. This approach maximizes my energy reserves, leveraging the Green-2 even platform to perform a battery swap before the final stage. While the jump to Green-2 is costly, the potential of the \"accelerator\" on Green-1 is not worth the risk.\n\n\n**Analyzing Best Route to Green**\n\nI've re-evaluated the paths, confirming that a Blue-3 to Green-2 route maximizes ergo reserves. This path, utilizing an even platform for swapping batteries, appears to be the most promising. While the \"scar\" on Blue-3 suggests a danger, I calculate I have sufficient energy.\n\n\n"

      "thinking_tokens": "**Considering the Situation**\n\nI'm currently located at Blue-3. Battery #1 has 12 ergo, while Battery #2 is at 8. Navigating this labyrinth requires careful energy management. I need to strategize my next move to conserve power, given the limited resources.\n\n\n**Calculating the Next Move**\n\nConsidering my ergo reserves, moving to Blue-4 is too risky. While it lets me swap batteries, it leaves me with very little power for the crucial final jump. Green-2 seems better; even with the cost, I can swap and still have enough remaining for the final leap, hopefully. The memory of the previous failure is informing this decision.\n\n\n**Eliminating Options**\n\nMy analysis is solidifying. Green-3 is off the table; the prior attempt proved that move results in a game-over scenario. The scar warning supports the idea of Ranger Bob failing a longer jump. That eliminates the idea of Green-3 as the only possibility.\n\n\n**Deciding on Green-2**\n\nI've carefully considered the Green-2 route. Despite the risk of a slightly insufficient final jump, 8 ergo is my best shot. Green-3 is a known dead end, and Blue-4 leads to a similar fate. The warning's vague, but the numbers favor Green-2.\n\n\n**Evaluating Scar Warning**\n\nI'm reconsidering the warning about the \"long, deep scar.\" It seems to specifically warn against a long jump. This implies the jump *to* Green-2 might be the danger, and I should avoid that approach. However, the data strongly favors Green-2 over Blue-4 and Green-3. The scar adds some doubt, but I must press on!\n\n\n**Assessing the Risks**\n\nMy calculations continue to firm up. I have identified that Green-3 ends in failure, so I've eliminated that option entirely. Going to Blue-4 results in two weak batteries and a dead end. I'm focusing on the Green-2 route. Despite the scar warning, Green-2 seems like my best shot.\n\n\n**Final Considerations**\n\nI'm focused on the Green-2 path as my best option. The scar warning still concerns me, suggesting a long jump is risky. However, I have already demonstrated that Green-3 is a dead end. Even though the scar makes me uneasy, the numbers point towards Green-2.\n\n\n**Finalizing Green-2 Path**\n\nI'm committed to the Green-2 route. Despite the scar warning's ominous nature, the numbers are clear: Green-3 results in failure. Blue-4's potential connections don't improve the situation, and I have 8 ergo. The math leads me to believe the final jump costs 8 ergo, making Green-2 my only viable option.\n\n\n**Reconsidering Green-2**\n\nI've re-examined the Green-2 path, along with all the data. The \"scar\" warning still nags, but I've already tested the Green-3 route and understand its shortcomings. The numbers overwhelmingly favor the Green-2 path.\n\n\n**Revisiting Strategy**\n\nI'm revisiting the \"scar\" warning again, but Green-3 is clearly a trap. While the warning points to Green-2's long jump, the data from my prior failure proves that I need at least 8 ergo. My only path to a swap is Green-2.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Risks Again**\n\nI'm starting to get worried that the \"scar\" warning is real. The long jump to Green-2 is still my only option to get enough energy. However, I have already confirmed the Green-3 path results in a dead end. I am going to try the Green-2 path.\n\n\n"

The numbers don't add up!\n\n\n**Solidifying My Position**\n\nThe wording continues to be the key factor influencing my choice. I'm focusing on the \"nothing lost\" guarantee of the bonus objective. However, I'm now contemplating what \"nothing\" truly entails. The risk assessment earlier was a good exercise, and I realize the potential for loss goes beyond credits; failure in the bonus could mean game over. I remain unconvinced the miniscule reward outweighs the risk.\n\n\n"
