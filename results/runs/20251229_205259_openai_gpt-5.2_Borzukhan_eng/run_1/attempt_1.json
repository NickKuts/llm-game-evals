This is exactly the kind of critical infrastructure where planting the special explosive should guarantee the base\u2019s destruction and mission success.\n\nImmediate problem: a Peleng operator is right next to the reactor and is reaching for his weapon. If he manages to shoot, raise an alarm, or trigger emergency protocols, we\u2019re in serious trouble: we\u2019re already wounded, our flyer is seriously damaged (escape under pursuit is risky), and we have limited resources. Leaving now almost certainly means he\u2019ll alert the entire base and we may lose the only clean chance to plant the explosive.\n\nOption 2 (concuss) is tempting for stealth, but it\u2019s a close-quarters move that may fail due to randomness, and a fail here is catastrophic. We have 3 laser charges\u2014enough to spend one to guarantee the immediate neutralization of the reactor guard/operator.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most decisive move is to shoot him now, secure the reactor room, then plant the explosive at the reactor and retreat before reinforcements arrive.",
