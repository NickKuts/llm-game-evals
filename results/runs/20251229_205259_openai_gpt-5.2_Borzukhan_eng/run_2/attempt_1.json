Close distance before using the stunner (ideally after entering silently), and be ready with the laser as backup if the stun fails. Also plan to secure him immediately (weapons/comms, bind) before he can react.\n\nUseful info learned: Borzukhan regularly isolates in a cabin in the western woods; following/ambushing his squad provided ammo and a stunner and confirmed the \u201ccabin lead\u201d is a strong path to locating him."
