  "failure_reflection": "Key logical mistake: I tried to \u201cfinish\u201d the mission at the first plausible interior junction by planting explosives immediately, without confirming I\u2019d actually found the *core* of the base or the correct objective point. In these quests the win condition usually requires reaching a specific area (command room/warehouse/reactor/hangar) or obtaining information first (e.g., from the door room), not just setting a charge anywhere.\n\nWhat to do differently next time:\n- Don\u2019t assume any tunnel intersection is enough\u2014verify you\u2019re at the base\u2019s critical structure/objective location.\n- Use the nearby door with voices as an intelligence opportunity: listen longer, enter carefully, possibly capture/interrogate for directions/codes, or quietly clear a small room to avoid larger patrols.\n- Choose left/right systematically (map mentally, backtrack only when necessary), and avoid \u201cendgame\u201d actions until the quest clearly signals the correct target.\n- If there\u2019s any option earlier to treat wounds or get armor before assaulting, prioritize it.\n\nInfo discovered: the sea-grotto route can dead-end/loop; the mountain cave is a valid entry but triggers heavy guard response after explosions."
