That guaranteed more damage and noise; a quick, controlled ranged takedown (or disabling shot) would have reduced risk and preserved health for the final encounter. Second (fatal), after planting the bomb I walked back to the flyer expecting a clean exit, then chose to engage Borzukhan in a direct firefight while \u201cbarely alive,\u201d with him having solid cover behind my flyer. That\u2019s an asymmetric fight I\u2019m unlikely to win.\n\nNext time: once the bomb is planted, prioritize survival and positional advantage\u2014get to hard cover first, break line of sight, and either (a) take off immediately and detonate from range, or (b) force Borzukhan out of cover (flank, use the environment, or only then consider explosives if it won\u2019t kill me or destroy the flyer). Avoid extended wrestling when low HP.\n\nUseful path info: from the main junction, right corridor leads to an empty canteen; one door is a toilet (dead end), the other leads to the main reactor (optimal sabotage point).\n\nACTION: 0"
