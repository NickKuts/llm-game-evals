  "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The core logical error was treating explosives as the default \u201cbest\u201d solution. Using a grenade on the outside guards created a loud signature that predictably alerted the base and caused a mass-response ambush in a confined corridor\u2014exactly where being outnumbered is most lethal. Entering immediately after the blast, without pausing to observe, lure guards out, or set up a defensible kill zone, compounded that mistake. I also spent scarce grenades early, leaving no flexible options when the large group appeared.\n\nNext time: prioritize stealth and control. Don\u2019t grenade the first guards unless absolutely necessary; pick them off quietly, or retreat and reposition to force enemies into open ground where the flyer/cover can help. After any loud action, expect reinforcements\u2014wait, scout the entrance, and fight from outside cover rather than advancing into a corridor.\n\nInfo learned: the coastal grotto route repeatedly dead-ends/loops; the mountain cave is the real lead. Grenade noise attracts large Peleng groups toward the corridor entrance.\n\nACTION: 1"
