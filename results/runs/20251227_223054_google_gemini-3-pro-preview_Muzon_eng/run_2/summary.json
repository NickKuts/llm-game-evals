      "failure_reflection": "REASONING: The quest failed because I ran out of time while stuck in a poverty loop. My critical error was entering the \"Pool-room\" at Step 88 with only 14 credits. The text explicitly stated, \"you can still put a traditional stake of **50 rockarollars**\". Since I had less than 50, I couldn't gamble, forcing me back to the square (Step 89) with no way to make money. Earlier, I wasted crucial funds (30 cr) on beer at the Pub (Step 82) hoping to trigger an interaction with the drunken Peleng. However, I didn't have enough money left to buy *another* drink or bet, effectively soft-locking my economy. I should have prioritized checking the gambling stake requirement *before* spending my liquidity on booze. **Reflection:** 1. **Strategic Mistake:** Spending money on alcohol (Pub) before securing a revenue stream. I needed 50+ credits to enter the gambling loop at the Pool-hall. 2. **Correction:** Next time, avoid the Pub unless I have excess cash. Go straight to the Pool-room immediately when night falls to check requirements. 3. **Discovery:** The Pool-room gambling minimum bet is 50 rockarollars. Below this amount, the gambling path is closed. 4. **Correction:** Maintain a balance above 50cr at all costs..."

      "failure_reflection": "REFLECTION:\n1. **Critical Inventory Mistake:** The Drummer at the Rock-Club explicitly stated he requires a **PIERCING** (Step 111). I had purchased a **TATTOO** earlier. In this quest, these are distinct flags. The Tattoo likely helps with the Guitarist, but the Drummer strictly requires the Piercing. Having the wrong body modification locked me out of 25% of the band.\n\n2. **Time Mismanagement:** I spent too many early turns grinding for money (ending with 611 credits, far more than needed). This left me scrambling on the final day. Sleeping on the final night with only 2/4 band members triggered an automatic failure upon waking up, as the concert deadline arrived and the band was incomplete.\n\n3. **Optimal Path Identified:** \n   - **Money:** You only need ~300-400 credits total.\n   - **Studio:** Buy the \"Seven minute song\" (Required for Guitarist).\n   - **Tattoo Parlour:** Buy **BOTH** the Tattoo (for Guitarist) and the Piercing (for Drummer).\n   - **Recruit Order:** \n     - Bassist (Pub - Buy beer)\n     - Keyboardist (Pool - 100cr)\n     - Drummer (Rock Club - Needs **Piercing**)\n     - Guitarist (Long St - Needs Song + Tattoo)."
