I visited the Rock Club and Long Street repeatedly during times they were either closed or when I lacked the prerequisites to succeed (e.g., trying to recruit the drummer without a piercing). * **Ignoring Prerequisites:** The Drummer explicitly told me I needed a piercing (Step 92). Instead of going to the Tattoo Parlour (which was open next to the Pub) to get one, I wandered back to the square and wasted time elsewhere. This blocked the Drummer recruitment entirely. * **Skill Deficiency:** I repeatedly failed to recruit the Guitarist. The likely cause was my \"Average\" singing skill. I should have prioritized visiting the Studio early to rehearse and upgrade my skill to \"High\" or better *before* attempting difficult recruitments. 2. **Corrective Actions:** * **Prioritize Skill Upgrades:** Visit the Studio first thing to upgrade singing skill. * **Heed Specific Feedback:** When the Drummer asks for a piercing, IMMEDIATELY go to the Tattoo/Piercing parlour. * **Optimize Route:** Morning: Studio (Skill). Day: Pub (Bassist). Evening: Street (Guitarist) & Club (Drummer - after getting piercing). Night: Pool Room (Keyboardist). 3. **Key Info:** * **Long..."

      "failure_reflection": "**REFLECTION:** 1. **Strategic Mistake:** The primary error was misinterpreting the passage of time. The game ended abruptly after waking up because the concert deadline arrived. I spent 4 days preparing (Day 3, 2, 1, 0) but was inefficient. I wasted too many time slots (visits to empty locations like the Club/Pub at wrong times, or the Square without acting) and failed to recruit enough band members before the deadline. Specifically, I prioritized getting drunk/tattooed early without checking if those statuses blocked other paths (like the Bassist). 2. **Correction:** Efficient routing is paramount. * **Day 1:** Buy necessary items (Strings, Sticks) immediately on Long Street (Morning/Day). Train Singing at Studio (Morning). * **Recruitment Order:** * **Keyboardist (Club):** Requires Money + Info (from Peleng in Pub). Do this Evening/Night. * **Guitarist (Long St):** Requires High Singing skill + Strings. Do this Evening. * **Bassist (Pub):** Requires Sobriety (do *not* get drunk) + polite approach at Night. * **Drummer (Studio - Basement):** Check the Studio basement (or similar) properly. * **Status Management:** Do not get \"Drunk\" unless specifically required for a check, then sober up immediately (Coffee/Sleep). Being drunk blocked the Bassist recruitment, wasting a critical night slot. 3. **Key Info:** * **Bassist:**..."
