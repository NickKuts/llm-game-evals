Our scholars invented a unique device, which was sent to the Institute of Inventions and Innovations on planet Bonnasis for patenting. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to test it thoroughly so now we can't complete the application for the patent. There is only one test remaining - field-testing - but it is the most important one. We have already rented a test lab in the Institute and invited stuntmen but they failed to complete the testing.\r\n\r\nAs a ranger, you must be perfectly trained. We will even pay you twice as much as a stuntman gets - it makes 65535 cr, if you go to planet Bonnasis (system Procyon) and manage to test the device.

But there is one problem - the batteries are spent. I'd like to request you to use one of the first configurations of the testing facility to charge the batteries to the maximum , and I'll pay you 1000 cr. But at first you'll have to jump with the \"Jumper\" a little bit. You lose nothing and can get some profit - what would you say?",
