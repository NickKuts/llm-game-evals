I failed to account for this game-theoretic aspect.\n\n2. **Chose boxes that overlap multiple patterns**: Boxes 2 and 5 can both appear in the middle vertical line {2,5,8} AND in multiple 2x2 squares {1,2,4,5} and {2,3,5,6}. With both black, I couldn't distinguish between square and line patterns.\n\n**What to do differently:**\n\nNeed to pick two boxes that create a DEFINITIVE pattern regardless of adversary's choice. Likely solution involves:\n- Checking corner/edge boxes that have minimal overlap between square and line possibilities\n- Possibly boxes 1 and 7 (same column) - if both black = must be line {1,4,7}, if only one black = must be square\n- Or boxes that geometrically exclude one pattern type\n\n**Critical info:** Box 9 unusable, adversarial pattern selection after first pick, need corner-based strategy to force deterministic outcome."

The game ended without giving me that option, suggesting my strategy was fundamentally flawed or the game detected I couldn't determine the answer.\n\n2. **Box choice strategy error**: While box 1 (WHITE) and box 7 (BLACK) seemed to point to Square {4,5,7,8}, I may have missed that the adversary could still create ambiguity I didn't account for.\n\n3. **Didn't use the critical box 5**: Box 5 appears in ALL four square patterns but only ONE line pattern {2,5,8}. This asymmetry is the key to the puzzle.\n\n**Optimal Strategy for Next Time:**\n- First check: Box 5 (appears in all squares, one line)\n- If box 5 is BLACK: Check box 2 or 8 (distinguishes which line/square)\n- If box 5 is WHITE: Must be line {1,4,7} or {3,6,9}, check box 1 or 3\n\n**Key Pattern:** Box 5's unique frequency across pattern types makes it the optimal first choice for information gain against an adversary."
