The manual says that it's quite enough for the experts to define the overtone type, but it doesn't give even a hint to how one can do it. If you know the overtone type, all you need to do is just to push the other button, and the further tuning will be done automatically. Unfortunately, if one chooses the wrong overtone type, the further tuning can destroy the player completely.

      "was_auto": false,
      "thinking_tokens": "Alright, now I'm at the critical decision point. I need to choose two boxes to check, and Box 9 is unavailable.\n\nFrom my previous reflections:\n- The adversary chooses the pattern AFTER my first pick to make it most inconvenient\n- Box 5 is critical because it appears in ALL 4 square patterns but only 1 line pattern\n\nLet me map out the patterns:\n\n**Possible 2x2 squares (4 black boxes):**\n1. {1,2,4,5} - top-left\n2. {2,3,5,6} - top-right\n3. {4,5,7,8} - bottom-left\n4. {5,6,8,9} - bottom-right (but box 9 unavailable!)\n\n**Possible vertical lines (3 black boxes):**\n1. {1,4,7} - left column\n2. {2,5,8} - middle column\n3. {3,6,9} - right column (but box 9 unavailable!)\n\nWait, this is important! Box 9 being unavailable changes the problem:\n\n**Available squares:**\n1. {1,2,4,5}\n2. {2,3,5,6}\n3. {4,5,7,8}\n4. {5,6,8,9} - BUT we can't check box 9!\n\n**Available lines:**\n1. {1,4,7}\n2. {2,5,8}\n3. {3,6,9} - BUT we can't check box 9!\n\nSo if the pattern is square {5,6,8,9}, I can only check three of the four boxes. If the pattern is line {3,6,9}, I can only check two of the three boxes.\n\nLet me think about Box 5's special property:\n- Box 5 appears in ALL THREE checkable square patterns: {1,2,4,5}, {2,3,5,6}, {4,5,7,8}\n\n\n- Box 5 appears in only ONE line pattern: {2,5,8}\n\nThis makes Box 5 the optimal first choice. If it's black, the pattern could be any of three squares or the middle line. If it's white, I can eliminate all squares and know the pattern must be one of the two remaining lines.\n\nFor the second check, I need to distinguish between possibilities. Testing Box 2 when Box 5 is black creates ambiguity\u2014it could still be multiple squares or the line. But checking Box 8 would help narrow things down more effectively.\n\nWhen Box 5 is white, the shape must be one of the two vertical lines. A follow-up check at Box 1 would resolve this: black means {1,4,7}, white means {3,6,9}.\n\nThe adversary responds after my first query, so they'll strategically pick whichever option creates the most ambiguity given my result. If Box 5 is black, they might choose the line through it or a square. If white, they'll pick between the two vertical lines.\n\nLet me reconsider with opposite corners instead. Testing Box 1 and Box 3 simultaneously:\n- Both black would require overlapping squares, which is impossible since two distinct squares can't both be entirely black\n- If Box 1 is black, the shape is either the top-left square or the left vertical line\n- If Box 3 is black, it's either the top-right square or the right vertical line\n- Having both black forces a contradiction, narrowing down the possibilities significantly make this happen!\n\nSo checking boxes 1 and 3 reveals something crucial: if both are black, that's impossible since no single pattern contains them together. Box 1 black with box 3 white points to either square {1,2,4,5} or line {1,4,7}, leaving ambiguity. Box 1 white with box 3 black suggests square {2,3,5,6} or line {3,6,9}, also ambiguous. When both are white, many patterns fit.\n\nThis approach isn't yielding enough information. Let me try box 5 first instead, then choose the second box more strategically. If box 5 is black, it could belong to any square or the line {2,5,8}. I need to pick a box that appears in some squares but not in that line to narrow things down.\n\nBox 1 works perfectly for this\u2014it's in square {1,2,4,5} but not in line {2,5,8}. When both box 5 and box 1 are black, the pattern must be square {1,2,4,5}. However, if box 5 is black and box 1 is white, I'm stuck with three possibilities: squares {2,3,5,6} and {4,5,7,8}, or line {2,5,8}.\n\nBut if box 5 is white, it narrows to either line {1,4,7} or {3,6,9}. Then checking box 1 resolves it completely\u2014black means line {1,4,7}, white means line {3,6,9}. The strategy of checking box 5 then box 1 works when box 5 is white, though the black case still leaves me with ambiguity that the adversary could exploit.\n\nI need a more robust approach. Let me reconsider boxes 1 and 7 instead, since they're both in the left column. If both are black, that uniquely identifies line {1,4,7}. But the other combinations\u2014one black and one white, or both white\u2014still leave multiple possibilities across squares and lines.\n\nGiven the limitations of any single pair, I'll start with box 5 since it provides the most information overall. Once I see what's there, I can make a more informed second choice.\n\nACTION: 5"

      "thinking_tokens": "Okay, Box 5 is BLACK. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nFrom my analysis:\n- Box 5 appears in ALL three verifiable square patterns: {1,2,4,5}, {2,3,5,6}, {4,5,7,8}\n- Box 5 appears in only ONE line pattern: {2,5,8}\n\nSince Box 5 is BLACK, this could be:\n1. Square pattern {1,2,4,5}\n2. Square pattern {2,3,5,6}\n3. Square pattern {4,5,7,8}\n4. Line pattern {2,5,8}\n\nNow I need to choose a second box that will definitively tell me whether it's a square or the line {2,5,8}.\n\nLet me think about each possible second choice:\n\n**Box 1:**\n- Appears in square {1,2,4,5}\n- Does NOT appear in squares {2,3,5,6} or {4,5,7,8}\n- Does NOT appear in line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Must be square {1,2,4,5}\n- If WHITE: Could be square {2,3,5,6}, square {4,5,7,8}, OR line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n\n**Box 2:**\n- Appears in squares {1,2,4,5} and {2,3,5,6}\n- Does NOT appear in square {4,5,7,8}\n- Appears in line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Could be square {1,2,4,5}, square {2,3,5,6}, OR line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n- If WHITE: Must be square {4,5,7,8}\n\n**Box 3:**\n- Appears in square {2,3,5,6}\n\n\n- Does NOT appear in squares {1,2,4,5} or {4,5,7,8}\n- Does NOT appear in line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Must be square {2,3,5,6}\n- If WHITE: Could be square {1,2,4,5}, square {4,5,7,8}, OR line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n\n**Box 4:**\n- Appears in squares {1,2,4,5} and {4,5,7,8}\n- Does NOT appear in square {2,3,5,6}\n- Does NOT appear in line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Could be square {1,2,4,5} or square {4,5,7,8} - still ambiguous between two squares\n- If WHITE: Must be square {2,3,5,6}\n\n**Box 6:**\n- Only appears in square {2,3,5,6}\n- Does NOT appear in line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Must be square {2,3,5,6}\n- If WHITE: Could be square {1,2,4,5}, square {4,5,7,8}, OR line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n\n**Box 7:**\n- Appears exclusively in square {4,5,7,8}\n- If BLACK: Must be square {4,5,7,8}\n- If WHITE: Could be square {1,2,4,5}, square {2,3,5,6}, OR line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n\n**Box 8:**\n- Appears in square {4,5,7,8} and line {2,5,8}\n- If BLACK: Could be either square {4,5,7,8} or line {2,5,8} - AMBIGUOUS\n- If WHITE: Could be square {1,2,4,5} or square {2,3,5,6}\n\nI need to reconsider my approach. The real challenge is finding a box that uniquely identifies the line {2,5,8} and distinguishes it from all possible squares. I should focus on which boxes appear in the line but not in certain squares, or vice versa.\n\nThe strongest strategy would be selecting a box that either confirms it's a square when BLACK or confirms it's the line when WHITE. Boxes outside the line {2,5,8} like 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 would prove it's a square if they appear BLACK, but wouldn't definitively rule out the line if WHITE.\n\nSince the adversary chooses the pattern after my first move, they'll respond strategically to whatever I pick. d box lets me uniquely determine the pattern. If I pick Box 2 and it's WHITE, that uniquely identifies Square {4,5,7,8}. But if it's BLACK, I can't distinguish between three possibilities. Box 8 has similar issues\u2014if it's BLACK, I still can't tell Square {4,5,7,8} from Line {2,5,8}.\n\nSo Box 2 is the better choice because one outcome (WHITE) gives me certainty, whereas Box 8 leaves ambiguity in both cases. 7 is WHITE: Squares {1,2,4,5}, {2,3,5,6}, or Line {2,5,8} - can't distinguish!\n\nThe corner boxes all have the same issue\u2014one color gives a unique answer while the other leaves multiple possibilities. But I'm realizing the adversary can't retroactively change the pattern after I've made my selections. The pattern is fixed from the start, so I just need a second box that provides enough information to narrow it down.\n\nLooking back at the corner options where at least one outcome is definitive, Box 1 BLACK uniquely identifies Square {1,2,4,5}, Box 3 BLACK uniquely identifies Square {2,3,5,6}, and Box 7 BLACK uniquely identifies Square {4,5,7,8}. These seem like the most promising leads.\n\nBut Box 2 is interesting because it's absent from one pattern entirely\u2014it's not in Square {4,5,7,8}. So if Box 2 comes back WHITE, that immediately rules out that square. If it's BLACK, I'm still stuck between three possibilities.\n\nThe real issue is that I need a box where both outcomes lead to certainty. A box that's in exactly one square and exactly one line won't work, since I can't distinguish them. I should look for boxes outside the line {2,5,8} entirely, since those would eliminate at least one category of possibilities outright.\n\nChecking boxes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7: each one appears in multiple squares, so a BLACK result still leaves me uncertain whether it's one square or another. And WHITE doesn't help either\u2014it could indicate any number of remaining squares or the line. The same problem repeats with boxes 2 and 8 when I consider them as line-adjacent options. I'm stuck because no single box can give me a definitive answer in both directions.\n\nWait\u2014I don't actually need to identify which specific square. I just need to distinguish \"square\" from \"line.\" If Box 8 is WHITE, it eliminates the line {2,5,8} entirely since Box 8 belongs there. That forces the answer to be one of the squares containing Box 8.\n\nBut if Box 8 is BLACK, I'm back to ambiguity\u2014it could still be either the line or a square.\n\nLet me reconsider Box 2 instead. When Box 2 is WHITE, the only possibility is the square {4,5,7,8}. When it's BLACK, I get multiple options including the line {2,5,8}, but squares still appear in two of the three possibilities. So there's a probabilistic advantage even in the uncertain case.\n\nBox 2 seems like the better choice."
