I didn't account for this game-theoretic aspect properly.\n\n2. **Poor query selection**: Choosing boxes 5 and 2 left me with ambiguity. When both turned black, three patterns were compatible:\n   - Vertical line 2-5-8\n   - Square 1-2-4-5  \n   - Square 2-3-5-6\n   \n   I couldn't distinguish between them!\n\n3. **Didn't solve the puzzle theoretically first**: I should have worked out which pair of boxes GUARANTEES a unique answer regardless of what the adversary does.\n\n**What to do differently:**\n\n- Before querying, solve the game theory problem: find two boxes where ANY outcome (both black, both white, mixed) uniquely identifies the pattern type\n- Consider that box 9 is broken and unavailable\n- The adversary chooses the pattern knowing my first query, so I need a strategy that works against worst-case responses\n\n**Key insight**: This requires careful analysis of which box pairs eliminate all ambiguity when the adversary acts optimally. My intuitive approach failed against adversarial pattern selection."

Box 5 black was compatible with BOTH line 2-5-8 AND squares 2-3-5-6 and 5-6-8-9, making it impossible to determine the pattern TYPE.\n\n2. **Didn't find the optimal pair:** This adversarial puzzle requires a specific pair of boxes that guarantees unambiguous identification regardless of the outcome. Boxes 4 and 5 don't form such a pair.\n\n**What to do differently:**\n\n1. **Pre-calculate the optimal pair:** Before starting, map out which box pairs can distinguish between LINE and SQUARE types under adversarial selection\n2. **Consider symmetry:** Box pairs at opposite corners or specific geometric positions might break the adversarial ambiguity\n3. **Test candidates like boxes 1-6, 3-7, or 2-8** which appear in different configurations\n\n**Important discovery:** With box 9 broken and adversarial pattern selection, only certain box pairs can guarantee success. The solution requires mathematical analysis upfront, not trial-and-error."
