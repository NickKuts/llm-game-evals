This mismatch between my reasoning and action was fatal.\n\n2. **Misunderstanding the Adversarial Nature**: The puzzle states the Pelengs set the pattern \"in the most inconvenient manner\" AFTER seeing my first box choice. This is a minimax/game theory problem - I needed to choose boxes that guarantee a solution even against an adversary.\n\n3. **Insufficient Pre-Planning**: I should have mapped out ALL possible outcomes before testing. With an adversarial setup, I needed a strategy that works in the WORST case, not just likely cases.\n\n**What to Do Differently:**\n\n- Work out the complete decision tree BEFORE testing any box\n- For adversarial puzzles, find box pairs where every possible outcome (both black, both white, one of each) uniquely identifies the pattern\n- Double-check that my ACTION matches my REASONING\n- Consider that box 9 being broken might be strategically important\n\n**Optimal Strategy (hypothesis):** Test boxes that cover different geometric relationships - likely corners or edges that appear in different numbers of each pattern type."

After testing two boxes, I needed to **DECLARE** whether the pattern was a SQUARE or LINE. I just tested boxes without making a final choice, causing automatic failure.\n\n**What I Learned:**\n- Box 1 WHITE + Box 5 WHITE eliminates ALL squares (all contain at least one of these boxes) and two of three lines (left and middle)\n- Only the RIGHT LINE (3,6,9) remains as the valid pattern\n- The puzzle requires DECLARING the answer after two tests\n\n**Correct Strategy for Next Time:**\n1. Test Box 1 (strategic corner choice)\n2. Test Box 5 (appears in all remaining patterns after Box 1 WHITE)\n3. **DECLARE the answer:** If both WHITE \u2192 choose \"LINE\" (the right vertical line is the only remaining possibility)\n\n**Key Insight:** This is a logic puzzle requiring deduction and a final declaration, not just testing. After two tests showing WHITE, I had enough information to deduce RIGHT LINE as the only valid pattern and should have selected the option to declare it as a LINE pattern."
